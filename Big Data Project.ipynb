Her mother had died\\r\\ntoo long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of\\r\\nher caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as\\r\\ngoverness, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse’s family, less as a\\r\\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\\r\\nof Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before\\r\\nMiss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the\\r\\nmildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint;\\r\\nand the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been\\r\\nliving together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma\\r\\ndoing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’s judgment, but\\r\\ndirected chiefly by her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of having\\r\\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\\r\\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\\r\\nher many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived,\\r\\nthat they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\\r\\ndisagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor’s\\r\\nloss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\\r\\nbeloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\\r\\ncontinuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and\\r\\nherself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer\\r\\na long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as\\r\\nusual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston\\r\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\\r\\npleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\\r\\nwith what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\\r\\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her. The want\\r\\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\\r\\npast kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she had\\r\\ntaught and how she had played with her from five years old--how she had\\r\\ndevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and how\\r\\nnursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\\r\\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven\\r\\nyears, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\\r\\nIsabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\\r\\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\\r\\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\\r\\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\\r\\npeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\\r\\nhers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\\r\\nsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going\\r\\nonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\\r\\ndifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss\\r\\nTaylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic,\\r\\nshe was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She\\r\\ndearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not\\r\\nmeet her in conversation, rational or playful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\\r\\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\\r\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of\\r\\nmind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\\r\\neverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\\r\\ntemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\\r\\nsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\\r\\nreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\\r\\nthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\\r\\nIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\\r\\nand give her pleasant society again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\\r\\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\\r\\nname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses\\r\\nwere first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\\r\\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\\r\\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even\\r\\nhalf a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over\\r\\nit, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it\\r\\nnecessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous\\r\\nman, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and\\r\\nhating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the\\r\\norigin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet\\r\\nreconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor could ever speak of her\\r\\nbut with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\\r\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his\\r\\nhabits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that\\r\\nother people could feel differently from himself, he was very much\\r\\ndisposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for\\r\\nthem, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the\\r\\nrest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully\\r\\nas she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was\\r\\nimpossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\\r\\nMr. Weston ever thought of her!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such\\r\\na good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\\r\\na good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\\r\\never, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\\r\\nown?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\\r\\nThis is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my\\r\\ndear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We\\r\\nshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\\r\\nvisit very soon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\\r\\nnot walk half so far.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\\r\\nto be sure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\\r\\nlittle way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\\r\\nvisit?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are to be put into Mr. Weston’s stable, papa. You know we have\\r\\nsettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\\r\\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\\r\\nto Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. I only\\r\\ndoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\\r\\npapa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\\r\\nmentioned her--James is so obliged to you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\\r\\nhave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\\r\\nsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\\r\\ngirl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\\r\\ncurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\\r\\nhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\\r\\nof the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\\r\\nexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\\r\\nto have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\\r\\nover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\\r\\nbe able to tell her how we all are.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\\r\\nhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\\r\\nthrough the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\\r\\nbackgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked\\r\\nin and made it unnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\\r\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\\r\\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella’s husband. He lived\\r\\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\\r\\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\\r\\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\\r\\nsome days’ absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\\r\\nwell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\\r\\nalways did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and\\r\\nher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\\r\\nto come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have\\r\\nhad a shocking walk.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\\r\\nmust draw back from your great fire.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\\r\\ncatch cold.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\\r\\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\\r\\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\\r\\nsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\\r\\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\\r\\nall behave? Who cried most?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! poor Miss Taylor! ‘Tis a sad business.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\\r\\n‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\\r\\ncomes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it\\r\\nmust be better to have only one to please than two.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\\r\\ncreature!” said Emma playfully. “That is what you have in your head, I\\r\\nknow--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse, with a\\r\\nsigh. “I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\\r\\nKnightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\\r\\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--in a\\r\\njoke--it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\\r\\nin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\\r\\nthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew\\r\\nit would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\\r\\nreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\\r\\nevery body.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I meant no\\r\\nreflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\\r\\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a\\r\\ngainer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass--“you want to hear about\\r\\nthe wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\\r\\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not\\r\\na tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we\\r\\nwere going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every\\r\\nday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father. “But, Mr.\\r\\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\\r\\nsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. “It\\r\\nis impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.\\r\\nKnightley. “We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\\r\\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s\\r\\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s\\r\\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\\r\\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\\r\\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\\r\\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a very\\r\\nconsiderable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you\\r\\nknow, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the\\r\\nright, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may\\r\\ncomfort me for any thing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, “Ah!\\r\\nmy dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\\r\\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\\r\\nmatches.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\\r\\nother people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\\r\\nsuccess, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\\r\\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\\r\\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\\r\\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\\r\\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--Mr. Weston need not spend\\r\\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\\r\\nWeston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\\r\\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\\r\\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\\r\\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I met\\r\\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\\r\\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\\r\\nFarmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match\\r\\nfrom that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,\\r\\ndear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said Mr. Knightley.\\r\\n“Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\\r\\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\\r\\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! But\\r\\nif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means\\r\\nonly your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I think it\\r\\nwould be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry\\r\\nher,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why\\r\\ndo you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You\\r\\nmade a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--I\\r\\npity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\\r\\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my\\r\\npoor word ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\\r\\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\\r\\nbut I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing and\\r\\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits here, and given\\r\\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\\r\\nnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\\r\\nenough to comprehend that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\\r\\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\\r\\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\\r\\ngood to them, by interference.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined\\r\\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. “But, my dear, pray do not\\r\\nmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s family\\r\\ncircle grievously.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\\r\\nElton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\\r\\nHighbury who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, and has\\r\\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him\\r\\nsingle any longer--and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day,\\r\\nhe looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office\\r\\ndone for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I\\r\\nhave of doing him a service.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young\\r\\nman, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any\\r\\nattention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will\\r\\nbe a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to\\r\\nmeet him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr. Knightley,\\r\\nlaughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\\r\\nthing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\\r\\nand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\\r\\nman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\\r\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\r\\ngentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\\r\\nsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\\r\\nfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\\r\\nand had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering\\r\\ninto the militia of his county, then embodied.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\\r\\nmilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire\\r\\nfamily, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized,\\r\\nexcept her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were\\r\\nfull of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\\r\\nfortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was\\r\\nnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\\r\\ninfinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with\\r\\ndue decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much\\r\\nhappiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a\\r\\nhusband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due\\r\\nto her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\\r\\nbut though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\\r\\nresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother,\\r\\nbut not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’s\\r\\nunreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\\r\\nThey lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\\r\\nof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\\r\\nonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\\r\\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\\r\\nthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he\\r\\nwas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\\r\\nFrom the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\\r\\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\\r\\nmother’s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature\\r\\nof equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the\\r\\nlittle Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some reluctance\\r\\nthe widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were\\r\\novercome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and\\r\\nthe wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek,\\r\\nand his own situation to improve as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nA complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\\r\\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\\r\\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\\r\\nbrought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\\r\\nwhere most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation\\r\\nand the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his\\r\\nlife passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy\\r\\ncompetence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining\\r\\nHighbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as\\r\\nportionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of\\r\\nhis own friendly and social disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\\r\\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,\\r\\nit had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\\r\\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\\r\\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\\r\\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\\r\\nhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\\r\\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\\r\\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\\r\\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\\r\\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\\r\\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\\r\\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\\r\\nfor as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\\r\\nuncle’s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\\r\\nthe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore,\\r\\nthat he should ever want his father’s assistance. His father had no\\r\\napprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her\\r\\nhusband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston’s nature to imagine that\\r\\nany caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he\\r\\nbelieved, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, and\\r\\nwas proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man\\r\\nhad made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked on as\\r\\nsufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a\\r\\nkind of common concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\\r\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\\r\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\\r\\nhis father had been often talked of but never achieved.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\\r\\nmost proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a\\r\\ndissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with\\r\\nMrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now\\r\\nwas the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope\\r\\nstrengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new\\r\\nmother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury\\r\\nincluded some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.\\r\\n“I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill\\r\\nhas written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter,\\r\\nindeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and\\r\\nhe says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\\r\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\\r\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\\r\\nwelcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\\r\\nwhich her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\\r\\nfortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\\r\\nshe might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\\r\\nseparation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\\r\\nwho could ill bear to part with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\\r\\npain, of Emma’s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour’s ennui,\\r\\nfrom the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\\r\\ncharacter; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would\\r\\nhave been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\\r\\nwould bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\\r\\nprivations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of\\r\\nRandalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,\\r\\nand in Mr. Weston’s disposition and circumstances, which would make the\\r\\napproaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in\\r\\nthe week together.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\\r\\nWeston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more\\r\\nthan satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\\r\\nthat Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\\r\\nat his being still able to pity ‘poor Miss Taylor,’ when they left her\\r\\nat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\\r\\nin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\\r\\nown. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse’s giving a gentle sigh,\\r\\nand saying, “Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to\\r\\npity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\\r\\nThe compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\\r\\nbeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\\r\\nhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach\\r\\ncould bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\\r\\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit\\r\\nfor any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them\\r\\nfrom having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\\r\\nearnestly tried to prevent any body’s eating it. He had been at the\\r\\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry\\r\\nwas an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\\r\\nof the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse’s life; and upon being applied to, he\\r\\ncould not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\\r\\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\\r\\nmany--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\\r\\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\\r\\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\\r\\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\\r\\nseen with a slice of Mrs. Weston’s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\\r\\nWoodhouse would never believe it.\\r\\n\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeffNORTHANGER ABBEY\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have\\r\\nsupposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the character\\r\\nof her father and mother, her own person and disposition, were\\r\\nall equally against her. Her father was a clergyman, without being\\r\\nneglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his name\\r\\nwas Richard--and he had never been handsome. He had a considerable\\r\\nindependence besides two good livings--and he was not in the least\\r\\naddicted to locking up his daughters. Her mother was a woman of useful\\r\\nplain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a\\r\\ngood constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and\\r\\ninstead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might\\r\\nexpect, she still lived on--lived to have six children more--to see them\\r\\ngrowing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself. A family\\r\\nof ten children will be always called a fine family, where there are\\r\\nheads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had\\r\\nlittle other right to the word, for they were in general very plain, and\\r\\nCatherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any. She had a thin\\r\\nawkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong\\r\\nfeatures--so much for her person; and not less unpropitious for heroism\\r\\nseemed her mind. She was fond of all boy’s plays, and greatly preferred\\r\\ncricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic enjoyments of\\r\\ninfancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a\\r\\nrose-bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she gathered\\r\\nflowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief--at least\\r\\nso it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was\\r\\nforbidden to take. Such were her propensities--her abilities were quite\\r\\nas extraordinary. She never could learn or understand anything\\r\\nbefore she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often\\r\\ninattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her mother was three months in\\r\\nteaching her only to repeat the “Beggar’s Petition”; and after all, her\\r\\nnext sister, Sally, could say it better than she did. Not that Catherine\\r\\nwas always stupid--by no means; she learnt the fable of “The Hare and\\r\\nMany Friends” as quickly as any girl in England. Her mother wished her\\r\\nto learn music; and Catherine was sure she should like it, for she was\\r\\nvery fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet; so, at eight\\r\\nyears old she began. She learnt a year, and could not bear it; and Mrs.\\r\\nMorland, who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in\\r\\nspite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave off. The day which\\r\\ndismissed the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine’s life.\\r\\nHer taste for drawing was not superior; though whenever she could obtain\\r\\nthe outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd\\r\\npiece of paper, she did what she could in that way, by drawing houses\\r\\nand trees, hens and chickens, all very much like one another. Writing\\r\\nand accounts she was taught by her father; French by her mother: her\\r\\nproficiency in either was not remarkable, and she shirked her lessons in\\r\\nboth whenever she could. What a strange, unaccountable character!--for\\r\\nwith all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old, she had neither\\r\\na bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever\\r\\nquarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptions\\r\\nof tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and\\r\\ncleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the\\r\\ngreen slope at the back of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen, appearances were mending;\\r\\nshe began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion improved,\\r\\nher features were softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes gained more\\r\\nanimation, and her figure more consequence. Her love of dirt gave way to\\r\\nan inclination for finery, and she grew clean as she grew smart; she had\\r\\nnow the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark\\r\\non her personal improvement. “Catherine grows quite a good-looking\\r\\ngirl--she is almost pretty today,” were words which caught her ears now\\r\\nand then; and how welcome were the sounds! To look almost pretty is an\\r\\nacquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the\\r\\nfirst fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever\\r\\nreceive.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her children\\r\\neverything they ought to be; but her time was so much occupied in\\r\\nlying-in and teaching the little ones, that her elder daughters were\\r\\ninevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful\\r\\nthat Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should\\r\\nprefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about\\r\\nthe country at the age of fourteen, to books--or at least books of\\r\\ninformation--for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be\\r\\ngained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she\\r\\nhad never any objection to books at all. But from fifteen to seventeen\\r\\nshe was in training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroines\\r\\nmust read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so\\r\\nserviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Pope, she learnt to censure those who\\r\\n\\r\\n   “bear about the mockery of woe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Gray, that\\r\\n\\r\\n   “Many a flower is born to blush unseen,\\r\\n   “And waste its fragrance on the desert air.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Thompson, that--\\r\\n\\r\\n   “It is a delightful task\\r\\n   “To teach the young idea how to shoot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information--amongst\\r\\nthe rest, that--\\r\\n\\r\\n   “Trifles light as air,\\r\\n   “Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong,\\r\\n   “As proofs of Holy Writ.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\r\\n\\r\\n   “The poor beetle, which we tread upon,\\r\\n   “In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great\\r\\n   “As when a giant dies.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that a young woman in love always looks--\\r\\n\\r\\n   “like Patience on a monument\\r\\n   “Smiling at Grief.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far her improvement was sufficient--and in many other points she came\\r\\non exceedingly well; for though she could not write sonnets, she brought\\r\\nherself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her throwing\\r\\na whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her own\\r\\ncomposition, she could listen to other people’s performance with very\\r\\nlittle fatigue. Her greatest deficiency was in the pencil--she had no\\r\\nnotion of drawing--not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover’s\\r\\nprofile, that she might be detected in the design. There she fell\\r\\nmiserably short of the true heroic height. At present she did not know\\r\\nher own poverty, for she had no lover to portray. She had reached the\\r\\nage of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could call\\r\\nforth her sensibility, without having inspired one real passion, and\\r\\nwithout having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate\\r\\nand very transient. This was strange indeed! But strange things may be\\r\\ngenerally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out. There was\\r\\nnot one lord in the neighbourhood; no--not even a baronet. There was not\\r\\none family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy\\r\\naccidentally found at their door--not one young man whose origin\\r\\nwas unknown. Her father had no ward, and the squire of the parish no\\r\\nchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty\\r\\nsurrounding families cannot prevent her. Something must and will happen\\r\\nto throw a hero in her way.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Allen, who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton, the\\r\\nvillage in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, was ordered to Bath\\r\\nfor the benefit of a gouty constitution--and his lady, a good-humoured\\r\\nwoman, fond of Miss Morland, and probably aware that if adventures will\\r\\nnot befall a young lady in her own village, she must seek them abroad,\\r\\ninvited her to go with them. Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance,\\r\\nand Catherine all happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland’s\\r\\npersonal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all the\\r\\ndifficulties and dangers of a six weeks’ residence in Bath, it may be\\r\\nstated, for the reader’s more certain information, lest the following\\r\\npages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is\\r\\nmeant to be, that her heart was affectionate; her disposition cheerful\\r\\nand open, without conceit or affectation of any kind--her manners just\\r\\nremoved from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl; her person pleasing,\\r\\nand, when in good looks, pretty--and her mind about as ignorant and\\r\\nuninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs.\\r\\nMorland will be naturally supposed to be most severe. A thousand\\r\\nalarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this\\r\\nterrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness, and drown her\\r\\nin tears for the last day or two of their being together; and advice of\\r\\nthe most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her\\r\\nwise lips in their parting conference in her closet. Cautions against\\r\\nthe violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young\\r\\nladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve\\r\\nthe fulness of her heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knew\\r\\nso little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of their\\r\\ngeneral mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her\\r\\ndaughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined to the\\r\\nfollowing points. “I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up\\r\\nvery warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; and\\r\\nI wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I will\\r\\ngive you this little book on purpose.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSally, or rather Sarah (for what young lady of common gentility will\\r\\nreach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can?),\\r\\nmust from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante\\r\\nof her sister. It is remarkable, however, that she neither insisted\\r\\non Catherine’s writing by every post, nor exacted her promise of\\r\\ntransmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detail\\r\\nof every interesting conversation that Bath might produce. Everything\\r\\nindeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of the\\r\\nMorlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed\\r\\nrather consistent with the common feelings of common life, than with the\\r\\nrefined susceptibilities, the tender emotions which the first separation\\r\\nof a heroine from her family ought always to excite. Her father, instead\\r\\nof giving her an unlimited order on his banker, or even putting an\\r\\nhundred pounds bank-bill into her hands, gave her only ten guineas, and\\r\\npromised her more when she wanted it.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the\\r\\njourney began. It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful\\r\\nsafety. Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky\\r\\noverturn to introduce them to the hero. Nothing more alarming occurred\\r\\nthan a fear, on Mrs. Allen’s side, of having once left her clogs behind\\r\\nher at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey arrived at Bath. Catherine was all eager delight--her eyes were\\r\\nhere, there, everywhere, as they approached its fine and striking\\r\\nenvirons, and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted\\r\\nthem to the hotel. She was come to be happy, and she felt happy already.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen, that the\\r\\nreader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter\\r\\ntend to promote the general distress of the work, and how she will,\\r\\nprobably, contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate\\r\\nwretchedness of which a last volume is capable--whether by her\\r\\nimprudence, vulgarity, or jealousy--whether by intercepting her letters,\\r\\nruining her character, or turning her out of doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females, whose society can\\r\\nraise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world\\r\\nwho could like them well enough to marry them. She had neither beauty,\\r\\ngenius, accomplishment, nor manner. The air of a gentlewoman, a great\\r\\ndeal of quiet, inactive good temper, and a trifling turn of mind\\r\\nwere all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible,\\r\\nintelligent man like Mr. Allen. In one respect she was admirably fitted\\r\\nto introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going everywhere\\r\\nand seeing everything herself as any young lady could be. Dress was\\r\\nher passion. She had a most harmless delight in being fine; and our\\r\\nheroine’s entree into life could not take place till after three or four\\r\\ndays had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and her chaperone\\r\\nwas provided with a dress of the newest fashion. Catherine too made\\r\\nsome purchases herself, and when all these matters were arranged, the\\r\\nimportant evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms. Her\\r\\nhair was cut and dressed by the best hand, her clothes put on with care,\\r\\nand both Mrs. Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should\\r\\ndo. With such encouragement, Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured\\r\\nthrough the crowd. As for admiration, it was always very welcome when it\\r\\ncame, but she did not depend on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom\\r\\ntill late. The season was full, the room crowded, and the two ladies\\r\\nsqueezed in as well as they could. As for Mr. Allen, he repaired\\r\\ndirectly to the card-room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves.\\r\\nWith more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of\\r\\nher protegee, Mrs. Allen made her way through the throng of men by\\r\\nthe door, as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow; Catherine,\\r\\nhowever, kept close at her side, and linked her arm too firmly within\\r\\nher friend’s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling\\r\\nassembly. But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the\\r\\nroom was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd; it\\r\\nseemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she had imagined that\\r\\nwhen once fairly within the door, they should easily find seats and be\\r\\nable to watch the dances with perfect convenience. But this was far from\\r\\nbeing the case, and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the\\r\\ntop of the room, their situation was just the same; they saw nothing\\r\\nof the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies. Still they\\r\\nmoved on--something better was yet in view; and by a continued exertion\\r\\nof strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage\\r\\nbehind the highest bench. Here there was something less of crowd than\\r\\nbelow; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the\\r\\ncompany beneath her, and of all the dangers of her late passage through\\r\\nthem. It was a splendid sight, and she began, for the first time that\\r\\nevening, to feel herself at a ball: she longed to dance, but she had\\r\\nnot an acquaintance in the room. Mrs. Allen did all that she could do\\r\\nin such a case by saying very placidly, every now and then, “I wish you\\r\\ncould dance, my dear--I wish you could get a partner.” For some time\\r\\nher young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes; but they were\\r\\nrepeated so often, and proved so totally ineffectual, that Catherine\\r\\ngrew tired at last, and would thank her no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not long able, however, to enjoy the repose of the eminence\\r\\nthey had so laboriously gained. Everybody was shortly in motion for\\r\\ntea, and they must squeeze out like the rest. Catherine began to feel\\r\\nsomething of disappointment--she was tired of being continually pressed\\r\\nagainst by people, the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to\\r\\ninterest, and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she\\r\\ncould not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a\\r\\nsyllable with any of her fellow captives; and when at last arrived in\\r\\nthe tea-room, she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to\\r\\njoin, no acquaintance to claim, no gentleman to assist them. They saw\\r\\nnothing of Mr. Allen; and after looking about them in vain for a more\\r\\neligible situation, were obliged to sit down at the end of a table, at\\r\\nwhich a large party were already placed, without having anything to do\\r\\nthere, or anybody to speak to, except each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Allen congratulated herself, as soon as they were seated, on having\\r\\npreserved her gown from injury. “It would have been very shocking to\\r\\nhave it torn,” said she, “would not it? It is such a delicate muslin.\\r\\nFor my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room, I\\r\\nassure you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How uncomfortable it is,” whispered Catherine, “not to have a single\\r\\nacquaintance here!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, my dear,” replied Mrs. Allen, with perfect serenity, “it is very\\r\\nuncomfortable indeed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What shall we do? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if\\r\\nthey wondered why we came here--we seem forcing ourselves into their\\r\\nparty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aye, so we do. That is very disagreeable. I wish we had a large\\r\\nacquaintance here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish we had any--it would be somebody to go to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly.\\r\\nThe Skinners were here last year--I wish they were here now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Had not we better go away as it is? Here are no tea-things for us, you\\r\\nsee.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No more there are, indeed. How very provoking! But I think we had\\r\\nbetter sit still, for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd! How is my\\r\\nhead, my dear? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it, I am afraid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed, it looks very nice. But, dear Mrs. Allen, are you sure\\r\\nthere is nobody you know in all this multitude of people? I think you\\r\\nmust know somebody.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t, upon my word--I wish I did. I wish I had a large acquaintance\\r\\nhere with all my heart, and then I should get you a partner. I should be\\r\\nso glad to have you dance. There goes a strange-looking woman! What an\\r\\nodd gown she has got on! How old-fashioned it is! Look at the back.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time they received an offer of tea from one of their\\r\\nneighbours; it was thankfully accepted, and this introduced a light\\r\\nconversation with the gentleman who offered it, which was the only time\\r\\nthat anybody spoke to them during the evening, till they were discovered\\r\\nand joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Miss Morland,” said he, directly, “I hope you have had an\\r\\nagreeable ball.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very agreeable indeed,” she replied, vainly endeavouring to hide a\\r\\ngreat yawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish she had been able to dance,” said his wife; “I wish we could\\r\\nhave got a partner for her. I have been saying how glad I should be if\\r\\nthe Skinners were here this winter instead of last; or if the Parrys had\\r\\ncome, as they talked of once, she might have danced with George Parry. I\\r\\nam so sorry she has not had a partner!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall do better another evening I hope,” was Mr. Allen’s\\r\\nconsolation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company began to disperse when the dancing was over--enough to leave\\r\\nspace for the remainder to walk about in some comfort; and now was the\\r\\ntime for a heroine, who had not yet played a very distinguished part\\r\\nin the events of the evening, to be noticed and admired. Every five\\r\\nminutes, by removing some of the crowd, gave greater openings for her\\r\\ncharms. She was now seen by many young men who had not been near her\\r\\nbefore. Not one, however, started with rapturous wonder on beholding\\r\\nher, no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room, nor was she once\\r\\ncalled a divinity by anybody. Yet Catherine was in very good looks, and\\r\\nhad the company only seen her three years before, they would now have\\r\\nthought her exceedingly handsome.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was looked at, however, and with some admiration; for, in her own\\r\\nhearing, two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl. Such words\\r\\nhad their due effect; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter\\r\\nthan she had found it before--her humble vanity was contented--she\\r\\nfelt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a\\r\\ntrue-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration\\r\\nof her charms, and went to her chair in good humour with everybody, and\\r\\nperfectly satisfied with her share of public attention.\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeff\\r\\nPersuasion\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,\\r\\nfor his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there\\r\\nhe found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed\\r\\none; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by\\r\\ncontemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any\\r\\nunwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally\\r\\ninto pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations\\r\\nof the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he\\r\\ncould read his own history with an interest which never failed.  This\\r\\nwas the page at which the favourite volume always opened:\\r\\n\\r\\n           \"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,\\r\\ndaughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of\\r\\nGloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born\\r\\nJune 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5,\\r\\n1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer\\'s\\r\\nhands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of\\r\\nhimself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary\\'s birth--\\r\\n\"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,\\r\\nEsq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\" and by inserting most\\r\\naccurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable\\r\\nfamily, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;\\r\\nhow mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,\\r\\nrepresenting a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of\\r\\nloyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with\\r\\nall the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two\\r\\nhandsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and\\r\\nmotto:--\"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,\" and\\r\\nSir Walter\\'s handwriting again in this finale:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the\\r\\nsecond Sir Walter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot\\'s character;\\r\\nvanity of person and of situation.  He had been remarkably handsome in\\r\\nhis youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.  Few women\\r\\ncould think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could\\r\\nthe valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held\\r\\nin society.  He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to\\r\\nthe blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united\\r\\nthese gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and\\r\\ndevotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since\\r\\nto them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any\\r\\nthing deserved by his own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,\\r\\nsensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be\\r\\npardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never\\r\\nrequired indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or\\r\\nconcealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for\\r\\nseventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world\\r\\nherself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children,\\r\\nto attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her\\r\\nwhen she was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest\\r\\nsixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an\\r\\nawful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a\\r\\nconceited, silly father.  She had, however, one very intimate friend, a\\r\\nsensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment\\r\\nto herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on\\r\\nher kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help\\r\\nand maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had\\r\\nbeen anxiously giving her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been\\r\\nanticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years had\\r\\npassed away since Lady Elliot\\'s death, and they were still near\\r\\nneighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other\\r\\na widow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well\\r\\nprovided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no\\r\\napology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably\\r\\ndiscontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but\\r\\nSir Walter\\'s continuing in singleness requires explanation.  Be it\\r\\nknown then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one\\r\\nor two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),\\r\\nprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters\\' sake.  For\\r\\none daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,\\r\\nwhich he had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nsucceeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother\\'s rights\\r\\nand consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her\\r\\ninfluence had always been great, and they had gone on together most\\r\\nhappily.  His two other children were of very inferior value.  Mary had\\r\\nacquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles\\r\\nMusgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of\\r\\ncharacter, which must have placed her high with any people of real\\r\\nunderstanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no\\r\\nweight, her convenience was always to give way--she was only Anne.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued\\r\\ngod-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all; but\\r\\nit was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her\\r\\nbloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had\\r\\nfound little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate\\r\\nfeatures and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in\\r\\nthem, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem. He had\\r\\nnever indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in\\r\\nany other page of his favourite work.  All equality of alliance must\\r\\nrest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old\\r\\ncountry family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore\\r\\ngiven all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or\\r\\nother, marry suitably.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she\\r\\nwas ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been\\r\\nneither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely\\r\\nany charm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome\\r\\nMiss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter\\r\\nmight be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be\\r\\ndeemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming\\r\\nas ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he\\r\\ncould plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance\\r\\nwere growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the\\r\\nneighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow\\'s foot about\\r\\nLady Russell\\'s temples had long been a distress to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.\\r\\nThirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and\\r\\ndirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have\\r\\ngiven the idea of her being younger than she was.  For thirteen years\\r\\nhad she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at\\r\\nhome, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking\\r\\nimmediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and\\r\\ndining-rooms in the country.  Thirteen winters\\' revolving frosts had\\r\\nseen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood\\r\\nafforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled\\r\\nup to London with her father, for a few weeks\\' annual enjoyment of the\\r\\ngreat world.  She had the remembrance of all this, she had the\\r\\nconsciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and\\r\\nsome apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as\\r\\nhandsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and\\r\\nwould have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by\\r\\nbaronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she again\\r\\ntake up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,\\r\\nbut now she liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of her\\r\\nown birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,\\r\\nmade the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it\\r\\nopen on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and\\r\\npushed it away.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially\\r\\nthe history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.\\r\\nThe heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose\\r\\nrights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,\\r\\nin the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to\\r\\nmarry him, and her father had always meant that she should.  He had not\\r\\nbeen known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot\\'s death, Sir\\r\\nWalter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not\\r\\nbeen met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making\\r\\nallowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their\\r\\nspring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr\\r\\nElliot had been forced into the introduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the\\r\\nlaw; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his\\r\\nfavour was confirmed.  He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked\\r\\nof and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.  The\\r\\nfollowing spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,\\r\\nagain encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and\\r\\nthe next tidings were that he was married.  Instead of pushing his\\r\\nfortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he\\r\\nhad purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of\\r\\ninferior birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter had resented it.  As the head of the house, he felt that he\\r\\nought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so\\r\\npublicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\" he\\r\\nobserved, \"once at Tattersall\\'s, and twice in the lobby of the House of\\r\\nCommons.\"  His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little\\r\\nregarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as\\r\\nunsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter\\r\\nconsidered him unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them had\\r\\nceased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of\\r\\nseveral years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for\\r\\nhimself, and still more for being her father\\'s heir, and whose strong\\r\\nfamily pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter\\r\\nElliot\\'s eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her\\r\\nfeelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.  Yet so\\r\\nmiserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present\\r\\ntime (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could\\r\\nnot admit him to be worth thinking of again.  The disgrace of his first\\r\\nmarriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it\\r\\nperpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse;\\r\\nbut he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they\\r\\nhad been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most\\r\\nslightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and\\r\\nthe honours which were hereafter to be his own.  This could not be\\r\\npardoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were Elizabeth Elliot\\'s sentiments and sensations; such the cares\\r\\nto alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the\\r\\nprosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings\\r\\nto give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle,\\r\\nto fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no\\r\\ntalents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be\\r\\nadded to these.  Her father was growing distressed for money.  She\\r\\nknew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the\\r\\nheavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr\\r\\nShepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.  The Kellynch property was\\r\\ngood, but not equal to Sir Walter\\'s apprehension of the state required\\r\\nin its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,\\r\\nmoderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but\\r\\nwith her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he\\r\\nhad been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for him to\\r\\nspend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was\\r\\nimperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only\\r\\ngrowing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it\\r\\nbecame vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his\\r\\ndaughter.  He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town;\\r\\nhe had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?  Does it occur to\\r\\nyou that there is any one article in which we can retrench?\" and\\r\\nElizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm,\\r\\nset seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed\\r\\nthese two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,\\r\\nand to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which\\r\\nexpedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no\\r\\npresent down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these\\r\\nmeasures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real\\r\\nextent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged\\r\\nto confess to her soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose of\\r\\ndeeper efficacy.  She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her\\r\\nfather; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of\\r\\nlessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or\\r\\nrelinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose\\r\\nof; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no\\r\\ndifference.  He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the\\r\\npower, but he would never condescend to sell.  No; he would never\\r\\ndisgrace his name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted\\r\\nwhole and entire, as he had received it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the\\r\\nneighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;\\r\\nand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be\\r\\nstruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and\\r\\nreduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence\\r\\nof taste or pride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold\\r\\nor his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted\\r\\nby anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and\\r\\nonly begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent\\r\\njudgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully\\r\\nexpected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see\\r\\nfinally adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it\\r\\nmuch serious consideration.  She was a woman rather of sound than of\\r\\nquick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this\\r\\ninstance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.\\r\\nShe was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;\\r\\nbut she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter\\'s feelings, as solicitous\\r\\nfor the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was\\r\\ndue to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.  She was a\\r\\nbenevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments,\\r\\nmost correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with\\r\\nmanners that were held a standard of good-breeding.  She had a\\r\\ncultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;\\r\\nbut she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for\\r\\nrank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those\\r\\nwho possessed them.  Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the\\r\\ndignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his\\r\\nclaims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging\\r\\nlandlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and\\r\\nher sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to\\r\\na great deal of compassion and consideration under his present\\r\\ndifficulties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she was very\\r\\nanxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and\\r\\nElizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,\\r\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing:  she consulted Anne, who\\r\\nnever seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the\\r\\nquestion. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in\\r\\nmarking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to\\r\\nSir Walter. Every emendation of Anne\\'s had been on the side of honesty\\r\\nagainst importance.  She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete\\r\\nreformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of\\r\\nindifference for everything but justice and equity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If we can persuade your father to all this,\" said Lady Russell,\\r\\nlooking over her paper, \"much may be done.  If he will adopt these\\r\\nregulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able\\r\\nto convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability\\r\\nin itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the\\r\\ntrue dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the\\r\\neyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.  What will\\r\\nhe be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have\\r\\ndone, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his case; and\\r\\nit is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as\\r\\nit always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.  We\\r\\nmust be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has\\r\\ncontracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the\\r\\nfeelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,\\r\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be\\r\\nproceeding, his friends to be urging him.  She considered it as an act\\r\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all\\r\\nthe expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure,\\r\\nand saw no dignity in anything short of it.  She wanted it to be\\r\\nprescribed, and felt as a duty.  She rated Lady Russell\\'s influence\\r\\nhighly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own\\r\\nconscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty\\r\\nin persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.  Her\\r\\nknowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the\\r\\nsacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of\\r\\nboth, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell\\'s too gentle\\r\\nreductions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Anne\\'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little\\r\\nconsequence.  Lady Russell\\'s had no success at all: could not be put up\\r\\nwith, were not to be borne. \"What! every comfort of life knocked off!\\r\\nJourneys, London, servants, horses, table--contractions and\\r\\nrestrictions every where!  To live no longer with the decencies even of\\r\\na private gentleman!  No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once,\\r\\nthan remain in it on such disgraceful terms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quit Kellynch Hall.\"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr\\r\\nShepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter\\'s\\r\\nretrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done\\r\\nwithout a change of abode.  \"Since the idea had been started in the\\r\\nvery quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,\" he said, \"in\\r\\nconfessing his judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not\\r\\nappear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of\\r\\nliving in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient\\r\\ndignity to support.  In any other place Sir Walter might judge for\\r\\nhimself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in\\r\\nwhatever way he might choose to model his household.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of\\r\\ndoubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go was\\r\\nsettled, and the first outline of this important change made out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in\\r\\nthe country.  All Anne\\'s wishes had been for the latter.  A small house\\r\\nin their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell\\'s\\r\\nsociety, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes\\r\\nseeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her\\r\\nambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something\\r\\nvery opposite from her inclination fixed on.  She disliked Bath, and\\r\\ndid not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt\\r\\nthat he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to\\r\\ndissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer\\r\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament:  he might there be important\\r\\nat comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath over\\r\\nLondon had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient\\r\\ndistance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell\\'s spending\\r\\nsome part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of\\r\\nLady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for\\r\\nBath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should\\r\\nlose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne\\'s known wishes.  It\\r\\nwould be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in\\r\\nhis own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found the\\r\\nmortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter\\'s\\r\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne\\'s\\r\\ndislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,\\r\\nfirst, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school\\r\\nthere, after her mother\\'s death; and secondly, from her happening to be\\r\\nnot in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards\\r\\nspent there with herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must\\r\\nsuit them all; and as to her young friend\\'s health, by passing all the\\r\\nwarm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided;\\r\\nand it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits\\r\\ngood.  Anne had been too little from home, too little seen. Her spirits\\r\\nwere not high.  A larger society would improve them.  She wanted her to\\r\\nbe more known.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for\\r\\nSir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very\\r\\nmaterial part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the\\r\\nbeginning.  He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the\\r\\nhands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir\\r\\nWalter\\'s have found too much.  Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This,\\r\\nhowever, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own\\r\\ncircle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to\\r\\ndesign letting his house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word\\r\\n\"advertise,\" but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned the\\r\\nidea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint\\r\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on the\\r\\nsupposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\r\\nunexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,\\r\\nthat he would let it at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell\\r\\nhad another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir\\r\\nWalter and his family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had\\r\\nbeen lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.\\r\\nIt was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an\\r\\nunprosperous marriage, to her father\\'s house, with the additional\\r\\nburden of two children.  She was a clever young woman, who understood\\r\\nthe art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;\\r\\nand who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been\\r\\nalready staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady\\r\\nRussell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of\\r\\ncaution and reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and\\r\\nseemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because\\r\\nElizabeth deserved it.  She had never received from her more than\\r\\noutward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had\\r\\nnever succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, against\\r\\nprevious inclination.  She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying\\r\\nto get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the\\r\\ninjustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut\\r\\nher out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth\\r\\nthe advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in\\r\\nvain:  Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in\\r\\nmore decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs\\r\\nClay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her\\r\\naffection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her\\r\\nbut the object of distant civility.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell\\'s estimate, a very\\r\\nunequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;\\r\\nand a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of\\r\\nmore suitable intimates within Miss Elliot\\'s reach, was therefore an\\r\\nobject of first-rate importance.\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeff\\r\\nPRIDE AND PREJUDICE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\\r\\nof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\\r\\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\\r\\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property\\r\\nof some one or other of their daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that\\r\\nNetherfield Park is let at last?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\\r\\ntold me all about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was invitation enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\\r\\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\\r\\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\\r\\ndelighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he\\r\\nis to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to\\r\\nbe in the house by the end of next week.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is his name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bingley.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is he married or single?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\\r\\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How so? How can it affect them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You\\r\\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\\r\\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\\r\\nsoon as he comes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\\r\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\\r\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the\\r\\nparty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\r\\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\\r\\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\r\\nthe neighbourhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\r\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to\\r\\ngo, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no\\r\\nnewcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to\\r\\nvisit him if you do not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\r\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\r\\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though\\r\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\r\\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\r\\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are\\r\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\r\\nquickness than her sisters.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You\\r\\ntake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\r\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\r\\nthese last twenty years at least.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\r\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\\r\\nvisit them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\r\\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\\r\\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\\r\\nwas less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,\\r\\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,\\r\\nshe fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\\r\\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\\r\\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring\\r\\nhis wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\\r\\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\\r\\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\\r\\nsuddenly addressed her with:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother\\r\\nresentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the\\r\\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\\r\\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\\r\\nof her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\\r\\nnot depend on her serving you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain\\r\\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little\\r\\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\\r\\nthem ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is\\r\\nyour next ball to be, Lizzy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow fortnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back\\r\\ntill the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,\\r\\nfor she will not know him herself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\\r\\nMr. Bingley to _her_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\\r\\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\\r\\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\\r\\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,\\r\\nMrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as\\r\\nshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will\\r\\ntake it on myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\\r\\nnonsense!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do\\r\\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\\r\\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\\r\\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\\r\\ngreat books and make extracts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\r\\n\\r\\n“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\\r\\nBingley.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If\\r\\nI had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called\\r\\non him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\\r\\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.\\r\\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy\\r\\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\\r\\nwhile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\r\\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\r\\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a\\r\\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a\\r\\nword about it till now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,\\r\\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was\\r\\nshut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\\r\\nor me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so\\r\\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\\r\\nfor your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\\r\\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\\r\\nball.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\r\\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\\r\\nreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\\r\\ndinner.\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeff\\r\\nSENSE AND SENSIBILITY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estate\\r\\nwas large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\\r\\ntheir property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\\r\\nrespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\\r\\nsurrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a single\\r\\nman, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\\r\\nlife, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But her\\r\\ndeath, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\\r\\nalteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received\\r\\ninto his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal\\r\\ninheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to\\r\\nbequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and their\\r\\nchildren, the old Gentleman\\'s days were comfortably spent.  His\\r\\nattachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\\r\\ninterest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\\r\\ncomfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\\r\\nchildren added a relish to his existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\\r\\nlady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, was\\r\\namply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\\r\\nand half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his own\\r\\nmarriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\\r\\nwealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\\r\\nso really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\\r\\nof what might arise to them from their father\\'s inheriting that\\r\\nproperty, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their\\r\\nfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\\r\\nremaining moiety of his first wife\\'s fortune was also secured to her\\r\\nchild, and he had only a life-interest in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other\\r\\nwill, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He was neither so\\r\\nunjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but\\r\\nhe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\\r\\nbequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\\r\\nand daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and his\\r\\nson\\'s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as\\r\\nto leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear\\r\\nto him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or\\r\\nby any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for the\\r\\nbenefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and\\r\\nmother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by\\r\\nsuch attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three\\r\\nyears old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his\\r\\nown way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh\\r\\nall the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received\\r\\nfrom his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,\\r\\nand, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a\\r\\nthousand pounds a-piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Dashwood\\'s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was\\r\\ncheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,\\r\\nand by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce\\r\\nof an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\\r\\nimprovement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\\r\\nhis only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\\r\\nthousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for\\r\\nhis widow and daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.\\r\\nDashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness\\r\\ncould command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the\\r\\nfamily; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at\\r\\nsuch a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make\\r\\nthem comfortable.  His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,\\r\\nand Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might\\r\\nprudently be in his power to do for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted\\r\\nand rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well\\r\\nrespected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of\\r\\nhis ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman, he might\\r\\nhave been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even have\\r\\nbeen made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and\\r\\nvery fond of his wife.  But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature\\r\\nof himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to\\r\\nincrease the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand\\r\\npounds a-piece.  He then really thought himself equal to it.  The\\r\\nprospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\\r\\nbesides the remaining half of his own mother\\'s fortune, warmed his\\r\\nheart, and made him feel capable of generosity.-- \"Yes, he would give\\r\\nthem three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would\\r\\nbe enough to make them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he\\r\\ncould spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\"-- He\\r\\nthought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did\\r\\nnot repent.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo sooner was his father\\'s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,\\r\\nwithout sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,\\r\\narrived with her child and their attendants.  No one could dispute her\\r\\nright to come; the house was her husband\\'s from the moment of his\\r\\nfather\\'s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the\\r\\ngreater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood\\'s situation, with only common\\r\\nfeelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there was\\r\\na sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of\\r\\nthe kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of\\r\\nimmovable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with\\r\\nany of her husband\\'s family; but she had had no opportunity, till the\\r\\npresent, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of\\r\\nother people she could act when occasion required it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so\\r\\nearnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the\\r\\narrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had\\r\\nnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the\\r\\npropriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children\\r\\ndetermined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach\\r\\nwith their brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed\\r\\na strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified\\r\\nher, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and\\r\\nenabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,\\r\\nthat eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\\r\\nto imprudence.  She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was\\r\\naffectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\\r\\nthem: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which\\r\\none of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarianne\\'s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor\\'s.\\r\\nShe was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her\\r\\njoys, could have no moderation.  She was generous, amiable,\\r\\ninteresting: she was everything but prudent.  The resemblance between\\r\\nher and her mother was strikingly great.\\r\\n\\r\\nElinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister\\'s sensibility; but\\r\\nby Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.  They encouraged each\\r\\nother now in the violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief\\r\\nwhich overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought\\r\\nfor, was created again and again.  They gave themselves up wholly to\\r\\ntheir sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that\\r\\ncould afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in\\r\\nfuture.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could\\r\\nstruggle, she could exert herself.  She could consult with her brother,\\r\\ncould receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with\\r\\nproper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar\\r\\nexertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but\\r\\nas she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne\\'s romance, without\\r\\nhaving much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal\\r\\nher sisters at a more advanced period of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her\\r\\nmother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.\\r\\nAs such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by\\r\\nher husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\\r\\nbeyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really pressed them,\\r\\nwith some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no\\r\\nplan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she\\r\\ncould accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his\\r\\ninvitation was accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nA continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former\\r\\ndelight, was exactly what suited her mind.  In seasons of cheerfulness,\\r\\nno temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater\\r\\ndegree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness\\r\\nitself.  But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\\r\\nand as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended\\r\\nto do for his sisters.  To take three thousand pounds from the fortune\\r\\nof their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most\\r\\ndreadful degree.  She begged him to think again on the subject.  How\\r\\ncould he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,\\r\\nof so large a sum?  And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,\\r\\nwho were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no\\r\\nrelationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount.  It\\r\\nwas very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist\\r\\nbetween the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he\\r\\nto ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his\\r\\nmoney to his half sisters?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was my father\\'s last request to me,\" replied her husband, \"that I\\r\\nshould assist his widow and daughters.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he\\r\\nwas light-headed at the time.  Had he been in his right senses, he\\r\\ncould not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half\\r\\nyour fortune from your own child.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only\\r\\nrequested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their\\r\\nsituation more comfortable than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it\\r\\nwould have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.  He could\\r\\nhardly suppose I should neglect them.  But as he required the promise,\\r\\nI could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.\\r\\nThe promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.  Something\\r\\nmust be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new\\r\\nhome.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something need\\r\\nnot be three thousand pounds.  Consider,\" she added, \"that when the\\r\\nmoney is once parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will\\r\\nmarry, and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could be restored\\r\\nto our poor little boy--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said her husband, very gravely, \"that would make\\r\\ngreat difference.  The time may come when Harry will regret that so\\r\\nlarge a sum was parted with.  If he should have a numerous family, for\\r\\ninstance, it would be a very convenient addition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure it would.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were\\r\\ndiminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious\\r\\nincrease to their fortunes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth would do half so\\r\\nmuch for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters!  And as it is--only\\r\\nhalf blood!--But you have such a generous spirit!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would not wish to do any thing mean,\" he replied.  \"One had rather,\\r\\non such occasions, do too much than too little.  No one, at least, can\\r\\nthink I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly\\r\\nexpect more.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is no knowing what THEY may expect,\" said the lady, \"but we are\\r\\nnot to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can\\r\\nafford to do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds\\r\\na-piece.  As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have\\r\\nabout three thousand pounds on their mother\\'s death--a very comfortable\\r\\nfortune for any young woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no\\r\\naddition at all.  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst\\r\\nthem.  If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do\\r\\nnot, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten\\r\\nthousand pounds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the\\r\\nwhole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother\\r\\nwhile she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I\\r\\nmean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.\\r\\nA hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this\\r\\nplan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said she, \"it is better than parting with fifteen hundred\\r\\npounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years\\r\\nwe shall be completely taken in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that\\r\\npurchase.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when\\r\\nthere is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,\\r\\nand hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over\\r\\nand over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are not\\r\\naware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the trouble\\r\\nof annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to\\r\\nold superannuated servants by my father\\'s will, and it is amazing how\\r\\ndisagreeable she found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to be\\r\\npaid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then\\r\\none of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be\\r\\nno such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her income was not her\\r\\nown, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more\\r\\nunkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been\\r\\nentirely at my mother\\'s disposal, without any restriction whatever.  It\\r\\nhas given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would\\r\\nnot pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood, \"to have\\r\\nthose kind of yearly drains on one\\'s income.  One\\'s fortune, as your\\r\\nmother justly says, is NOT one\\'s own.  To be tied down to the regular\\r\\npayment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it\\r\\ntakes away one\\'s independence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.  They think\\r\\nthemselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises\\r\\nno gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done at\\r\\nmy own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them any\\r\\nthing yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a\\r\\nhundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should\\r\\nbe no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will\\r\\nbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they\\r\\nwould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger\\r\\nincome, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the\\r\\nyear.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fifty\\r\\npounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for\\r\\nmoney, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within\\r\\nmyself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at\\r\\nall.  The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might\\r\\nbe reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a\\r\\ncomfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,\\r\\nand sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they\\r\\nare in season.  I\\'ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\\r\\nit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.  Do but consider,\\r\\nmy dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law\\r\\nand her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,\\r\\nbesides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which\\r\\nbrings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will\\r\\npay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will have\\r\\nfive hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want\\r\\nfor more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will\\r\\nbe nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly\\r\\nany servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of\\r\\nany kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a\\r\\nyear! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as\\r\\nto your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They will\\r\\nbe much more able to give YOU something.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you are perfectly right.\\r\\nMy father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than\\r\\nwhat you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\\r\\nmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you\\r\\nhave described.  When my mother removes into another house my services\\r\\nshall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little\\r\\npresent of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  \"But, however, ONE thing\\r\\nmust be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland,\\r\\nthough the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and\\r\\nlinen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her house will\\r\\ntherefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacy\\r\\nindeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant\\r\\naddition to our own stock here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what\\r\\nbelongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for\\r\\nany place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.\\r\\nYour father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this: that you owe no\\r\\nparticular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we very\\r\\nwell know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the\\r\\nworld to THEM.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis argument was irresistible.  It gave to his intentions whatever of\\r\\ndecision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be\\r\\nabsolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the\\r\\nwidow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as\\r\\nhis own wife pointed out.\\r\\n'),\n",

But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\\r\\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country\\'s done for. You\\r\\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\\r\\ndead as a door-nail.\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\\r\\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\\'t know how many years. Scrooge\\r\\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his\\r\\nsole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even\\r\\nScrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was\\r\\nan excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and\\r\\nsolemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mention of Marley\\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\\r\\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\\r\\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\\r\\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\\'s Father died\\r\\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\\r\\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\\r\\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\\r\\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\\'s Church-yard, for\\r\\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\\'s weak mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\\'s name. There it stood, years\\r\\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\\r\\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\\r\\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\\r\\nwas all the same to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\\r\\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old\\r\\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\\r\\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\r\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\\r\\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\\r\\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\\r\\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\\r\\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\\r\\ndog-days; and didn\\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\\r\\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\\r\\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\\r\\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\\'t know where to have him. The\\r\\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\\r\\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"\\r\\nhandsomely and Scrooge never did.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \"My\\r\\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\" No beggars\\r\\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\\r\\no\\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\\r\\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\\'s dogs appeared to\\r\\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\\r\\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\\r\\nsaid, \"No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\\r\\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\\r\\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\\r\\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\\r\\nbiting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court\\r\\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\\r\\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\\r\\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\\r\\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\\r\\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\\r\\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\\r\\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\\r\\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\\r\\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by\\r\\nand was brewing on a large scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door of Scrooge\\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\\r\\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\\r\\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\\'s fire\\r\\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\\'t\\r\\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\\r\\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\\r\\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\\r\\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\\r\\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried a cheerful voice. It was\\r\\nthe voice of Scrooge\\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\\r\\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bah!\" said Scrooge. \"Humbug!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\\r\\nnephew of Scrooge\\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\\r\\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"You don\\'t mean\\r\\nthat, I am sure?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\\r\\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\\'re poor enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What right have you to be\\r\\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\\'re rich enough.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\\r\\n\"Bah!\" again; and followed it up with \"Humbug!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _\"A Merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried a\\r\\ncheerful voice._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I live in such a world\\r\\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\\'s\\r\\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\\r\\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\\r\\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \\'em through a round dozen\\r\\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\" said\\r\\nScrooge indignantly, \"every idiot who goes about with \\'Merry Christmas\\'\\r\\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\\r\\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas in your own way,\\r\\nand let me keep it in mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"But you don\\'t keep it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much good may it do you!\\r\\nMuch good it has ever done you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\\r\\nhave not profited, I dare say,\" returned the nephew; \"Christmas among\\r\\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when it\\r\\nhas come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\\r\\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\\r\\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\\r\\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\\r\\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\\r\\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\\r\\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\\r\\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\\r\\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good, and _will_ do me good; and I say,\\r\\nGod bless it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\\r\\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\\r\\nlast frail spark for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let me hear another sound from _you_,\" said Scrooge, \"and you\\'ll keep\\r\\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\\'re quite a powerful\\r\\nspeaker, sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you don\\'t go\\r\\ninto Parliament.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\\r\\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\\r\\nextremity first.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why?\" cried Scrooge\\'s nephew. \"Why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I fell in love.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\\r\\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \"Good\\r\\nafternoon!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\\r\\nit as a reason for not coming now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\\r\\nfriends?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\\r\\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\\r\\nin homage to Christmas, and I\\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\\r\\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And A Happy New Year!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\\r\\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\\r\\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\\r\\nthem cordially.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \"my\\r\\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\\r\\nabout a merry Christmas. I\\'ll retire to Bedlam.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\\'s nephew out, had let two other people\\r\\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\\r\\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\\'s office. They had books and papers in their\\r\\nhands, and bowed to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Scrooge and Marley\\'s, I believe,\" said one of the gentlemen, referring\\r\\nto his list. \"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\\r\\nMarley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\" Scrooge replied. \"He died\\r\\nseven years ago, this very night.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\\r\\npartner,\" said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\\r\\nword \"liberality\" Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\\r\\ncredentials back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\" said the gentleman,\\r\\ntaking up a pen, \"it is more than usually desirable that we should make\\r\\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\\r\\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\\r\\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge. \"Are they still in\\r\\noperation?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish I could say they were\\r\\nnot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both very busy, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\\r\\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I am very\\r\\nglad to hear it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\\r\\nor body to the multitude,\" returned the gentleman, \"a few of us are\\r\\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\\r\\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\\r\\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\\r\\nput you down for?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You wish to be anonymous?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you ask me what I wish,\\r\\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don\\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\\r\\nand I can\\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\\r\\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough; and those who are\\r\\nbadly off must go there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Many can\\'t go there; and many would rather die.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and\\r\\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\\'t know that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It\\'s enough for a man to\\r\\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\\'s.\\r\\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\\r\\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\\r\\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\\r\\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\\r\\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\\r\\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a\\r\\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\\r\\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\\r\\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\\r\\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\\r\\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\\r\\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\\r\\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\\r\\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\\r\\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\\r\\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\\r\\nas they passed. Poulterers\\' and grocers\\' trades became a splendid joke:\\r\\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\\r\\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\\r\\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\\r\\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\\'s household\\r\\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\\r\\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and blood-thirsty in the streets,\\r\\nstirred up to-morrow\\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\\r\\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\\r\\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\\'s nose with a touch of such\\r\\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\\r\\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\\r\\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\\r\\nstooped down at Scrooge\\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\\r\\nbut, at the first sound of\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"God bless you, merry gentleman,\\r\\n    May nothing you dismay!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer\\r\\nfled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\\r\\nfrost.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\\r\\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\\r\\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\\r\\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If quite convenient, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it\\'s not fair. If I was to\\r\\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\\'d think yourself ill used, I\\'ll be bound?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don\\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\\r\\nday\\'s wages for no work.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A poor excuse for picking a man\\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\\r\\nDecember!\" said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. \"But I\\r\\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\\r\\nmorning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\\r\\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\\r\\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\\r\\ngreat-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of\\r\\nboys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas-eve, and then ran\\r\\nhome to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman\\'s\\r\\nbuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\\r\\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\\r\\nwith his banker\\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\\r\\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\\r\\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\\r\\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\\r\\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\\r\\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\\r\\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being\\r\\nall let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who\\r\\nknew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\\r\\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\\r\\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\\r\\nthreshold.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\\r\\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\\r\\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\\r\\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\\r\\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\\r\\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\\r\\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\\r\\nlast mention of his seven-years\\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\\r\\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\\r\\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\\r\\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\\r\\nMarley\\'s face.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarley\\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\\r\\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\\r\\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\\r\\nMarley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\\r\\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath of hot air;\\r\\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\\r\\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\\r\\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\\r\\nits own expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\\r\\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\\r\\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\\r\\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\\r\\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\\r\\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\\'s pigtail sticking out into the\\r\\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\\r\\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed\\r\\nit with a bang.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\\r\\nand every cask in the wine merchant\\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\\r\\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\\r\\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\\r\\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\\r\\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\\r\\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\\r\\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\\r\\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\\r\\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\\r\\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\\r\\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\\r\\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\\'s dip.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\\r\\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\\r\\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\\r\\nthe face to desire to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\\r\\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\\r\\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\\r\\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\\r\\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\\r\\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\\r\\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\\r\\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\\r\\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\\r\\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\\r\\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract\\r\\nthe least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The\\r\\nfire-place was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and\\r\\npaved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the\\r\\nScriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh\\'s daughters, Queens of\\r\\nSheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like\\r\\nfeather beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in\\r\\nbutter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that\\r\\nface of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet\\'s rod,\\r\\nand swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at\\r\\nfirst, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the\\r\\ndisjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of\\r\\nold Marley\\'s head on every one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Humbug!\" said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter several turns he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the\\r\\nchair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that\\r\\nhung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with\\r\\na chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great\\r\\nastonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that, as he\\r\\nlooked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the\\r\\noutset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and\\r\\nso did every bell in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an\\r\\nhour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together. They were succeeded\\r\\nby a clanking noise, deep down below, as if some person were dragging a\\r\\nheavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant\\'s cellar. Scrooge then\\r\\nremembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\\r\\ndragging chains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the\\r\\nnoise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then\\r\\ncoming straight towards his door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won\\'t believe it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through\\r\\nthe heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its\\r\\ncoming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know him!\\r\\nMarley\\'s Ghost!\" and fell again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\\r\\ntights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his\\r\\npigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he\\r\\ndrew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like\\r\\na tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,\\r\\nkeys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His\\r\\nbody was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking\\r\\nthrough his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\\r\\nnever believed it until now.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through\\r\\nand through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\\r\\ninfluence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the\\r\\nfolded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not\\r\\nobserved before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his\\r\\nsenses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. \"What do you want\\r\\nwith me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much!\"--Marley\\'s voice, no doubt about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who are you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ask me who I _was_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who _were_ you, then?\" said Scrooge, raising his voice. \"You\\'re\\r\\nparticular, for a shade.\" He was going to say \"_to_ a shade,\" but\\r\\nsubstituted this, as more appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do it, then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn\\'t know whether a ghost so\\r\\ntransparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt\\r\\nthat, in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the\\r\\nnecessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the\\r\\nopposite side of the fire-place, as if he were quite used to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t,\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own\\r\\nsenses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you doubt your senses?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them. A slight disorder\\r\\nof the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,\\r\\na blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.\\r\\nThere\\'s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in\\r\\nhis heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\\r\\nsmart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his\\r\\nterror; for the spectre\\'s voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,\\r\\nwould play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something\\r\\nvery awful, too, in the spectre\\'s being provided with an infernal\\r\\natmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was\\r\\nclearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its\\r\\nhair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour\\r\\nfrom an oven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,\\r\\nfor the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a\\r\\nsecond, to divert the vision\\'s stony gaze from himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do,\" replied the Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well!\" returned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow this, and be for the\\r\\nrest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own\\r\\ncreation. Humbug, I tell you; humbug!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such\\r\\na dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,\\r\\nto save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his\\r\\nhorror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it\\r\\nwere too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its\\r\\nbreast!\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mercy!\" he said. \"Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do you believe in me or\\r\\nnot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and\\r\\nwhy do they come to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _To sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence,\\r\\nfor a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him._]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned, \"that the spirit\\r\\nwithin him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and\\r\\nwide; and, if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do\\r\\nso after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is\\r\\nme!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,\\r\\nand turned to happiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its\\r\\nshadowy hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell me why?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost. \"I made it link\\r\\nby link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free-will, and of my\\r\\nown free-will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge trembled more and more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the weight and length of the\\r\\nstrong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this,\\r\\nseven Christmas-eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a\\r\\nponderous chain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding\\r\\nhimself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable, but he\\r\\ncould see nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jacob!\" he said imploringly. \"Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak\\r\\ncomfort to me, Jacob!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have none to give,\" the Ghost replied. \"It comes from other regions,\\r\\nEbenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of\\r\\nmen. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all\\r\\npermitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.\\r\\nMy spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me;--in life my\\r\\nspirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;\\r\\nand weary journeys lie before me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his\\r\\nhands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he\\r\\ndid so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\" Scrooge observed in a\\r\\nbusiness-like manner, though with humility and deference.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Slow!\" the Ghost repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seven years dead,\" mused Scrooge. \"And travelling all the time?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The whole time,\" said the Ghost. \"No rest, no peace. Incessant torture\\r\\nof remorse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You travel fast?\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On the wings of the wind,\" replied the Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,\"\\r\\nsaid Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so\\r\\nhideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have\\r\\nbeen justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,\" cried the phantom, \"not to know\\r\\nthat ages of incessant labour, by immortal creatures, for this earth\\r\\nmust pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\\r\\nall developed! Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in\\r\\nits little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too\\r\\nshort for its vast means of usefulness! Not to know that no space of\\r\\nregret can make amends for one life\\'s opportunities misused! Yet such\\r\\nwas I! Oh, such was I!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,\" faltered Scrooge,\\r\\nwho now began to apply this to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Business!\" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. \"Mankind was my\\r\\nbusiness. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,\\r\\nforbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my\\r\\ntrade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my\\r\\nbusiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt held up its chain at arm\\'s length, as if that were the cause of all\\r\\nits unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At this time of the rolling year,\" the spectre said, \"I suffer most.\\r\\nWhy did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,\\r\\nand never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a\\r\\npoor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have\\r\\nconducted _me_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this\\r\\nrate, and began to quake exceedingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hear me!\" cried the Ghost. \"My time is nearly gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will,\" said Scrooge. \"But don\\'t be hard upon me! Don\\'t be flowery,\\r\\nJacob! Pray!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may\\r\\nnot tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the\\r\\nperspiration from his brow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is no light part of my penance,\" pursued the Ghost. \"I am here\\r\\nto-night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my\\r\\nfate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You were always a good friend to me,\" said Scrooge. \"Thankee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will be haunted,\" resumed the Ghost, \"by Three Spirits.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge\\'s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost\\'s had done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?\" he demanded in a\\r\\nfaltering voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I think I\\'d rather not,\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Without their visits,\" said the Ghost, \"you cannot hope to shun the\\r\\npath I tread. Expect the first to-morrow when the bell tolls One.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Couldn\\'t I take \\'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?\" hinted\\r\\nScrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third, upon\\r\\nthe next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.\\r\\nLook to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember\\r\\nwhat has passed between us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the\\r\\ntable, and bound it round its head as before. Scrooge knew this by the\\r\\nsmart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the\\r\\nbandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural\\r\\nvisitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over\\r\\nand about its arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apparition walked backward from him; and, at every step it took, the\\r\\nwindow raised itself a little, so that, when the spectre reached it, it\\r\\nwas wide open. It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they\\r\\nwere within two paces of each other, Marley\\'s Ghost held up its hand,\\r\\nwarning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot so much in obedience as in surprise and fear; for, on the raising of\\r\\nthe hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent\\r\\nsounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and\\r\\nself-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in\\r\\nthe mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in\\r\\nrestless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains\\r\\nlike Marley\\'s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were\\r\\nlinked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to\\r\\nScrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in\\r\\na white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who\\r\\ncried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an\\r\\ninfant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was,\\r\\nclearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and\\r\\nhad lost the power for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he\\r\\ncould not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the\\r\\nnight became as it had been when he walked home.\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had\\r\\nentered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,\\r\\nand the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say \"Humbug!\" but stopped at\\r\\nthe first syllable. And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the\\r\\nfatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull\\r\\nconversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of\\r\\nrepose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep upon\\r\\nthe instant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTAVE TWO\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Scrooge awoke it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could\\r\\nscarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his\\r\\nchamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret\\r\\neyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.\\r\\nSo he listened for the hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and\\r\\nfrom seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve!\\r\\nIt was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must\\r\\nhave got into the works. Twelve!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous\\r\\nclock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, it isn\\'t possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have slept through a\\r\\nwhole day and far into another night. It isn\\'t possible that anything\\r\\nhas happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his\\r\\nway to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve\\r\\nof his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very\\r\\nlittle then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and\\r\\nextremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and\\r\\nfro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if\\r\\nnight had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world.\\r\\nThis was a great relief, because \"Three days after sight of this First\\r\\nof Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,\" and so forth,\\r\\nwould have become a mere United States security if there were no days to\\r\\ncount by.\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over\\r\\nand over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more\\r\\nperplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarley\\'s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within\\r\\nhimself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew\\r\\nback again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and\\r\\npresented the same problem to be worked all through, \"Was it a dream or\\r\\nnot?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more,\\r\\nwhen he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a\\r\\nvisitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the\\r\\nhour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than\\r\\ngo to Heaven, this was, perhaps, the wisest resolution in his power.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must\\r\\nhave sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it\\r\\nbroke upon his listening ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ding, dong!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A quarter past,\" said Scrooge, counting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ding, dong!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Half past,\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ding, dong!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A quarter to it,\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ding, dong!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,\\r\\ndull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the\\r\\ninstant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the\\r\\ncurtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which\\r\\nhis face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and\\r\\nScrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face\\r\\nto face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am\\r\\nnow to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a child as like\\r\\nan old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the\\r\\nappearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a\\r\\nchild\\'s proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its\\r\\nback, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in\\r\\nit, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and\\r\\nmuscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength.\\r\\nIts legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper\\r\\nmembers, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist\\r\\nwas bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a\\r\\nbranch of fresh green holly in its hand: and, in singular contradiction\\r\\nof that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But\\r\\nthe strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there\\r\\nsprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and\\r\\nwhich was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a\\r\\ngreat extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness,\\r\\nwas _not_ its strangest quality. For, as its belt sparkled and\\r\\nglittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was light one\\r\\ninstant at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its\\r\\ndistinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with\\r\\ntwenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a\\r\\nbody: of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense\\r\\ngloom wherein they melted away. And, in the very wonder of this, it\\r\\nwould be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\" asked\\r\\nScrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if, instead of being\\r\\nso close beside him, it were at a distance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Long Past?\" inquired Scrooge; observant of its dwarfish stature.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No. Your past.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have\\r\\nasked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and\\r\\nbegged him to be covered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" exclaimed the Ghost, \"would you so soon put out, with worldly\\r\\nhands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those\\r\\nwhose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years\\r\\nto wear it low upon my brow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge\\r\\nof having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at any period of his life. He\\r\\nthen made bold to inquire what business brought him there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your welfare!\" said the Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that\\r\\na night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The\\r\\nSpirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Rise! and walk with me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the\\r\\nhour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and\\r\\nthe thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly\\r\\nin his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold\\r\\nupon him at that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman\\'s hand, was\\r\\nnot to be resisted. He rose: but, finding that the Spirit made towards\\r\\nthe window, clasped its robe in supplication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,\" said the Spirit, laying it upon\\r\\nhis heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more than this!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon\\r\\nan open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely\\r\\nvanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist\\r\\nhad vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with the\\r\\nsnow upon the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together as he looked\\r\\nabout him. \"I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch, though it had been\\r\\nlight and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man\\'s sense\\r\\nof feeling. He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air,\\r\\neach one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and\\r\\ncares long, long forgotten!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your lip is trembling,\" said the Ghost. \"And what is that upon your\\r\\ncheek?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a\\r\\npimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the Spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed the Ghost.\\r\\n\"Let us go on.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _\"You recollect the way?\" inquired the spirit. \"Remember\\r\\nit!\" cried Scrooge with fervour; \"I could walk it blindfold.\"_]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post,\\r\\nand tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its\\r\\nbridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen\\r\\ntrotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other\\r\\nboys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys were\\r\\nin great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were\\r\\nso full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"These are but shadows of the things that have been,\" said the Ghost.\\r\\n\"They have no consciousness of us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named\\r\\nthem every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why\\r\\ndid his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why\\r\\nwas he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\\r\\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several\\r\\nhomes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!\\r\\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The school is not quite deserted,\" said the Ghost. \"A solitary child,\\r\\nneglected by his friends, is left there still.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey left the high-road by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a\\r\\nmansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola\\r\\non the roof and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of\\r\\nbroken fortunes: for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\\r\\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\\r\\nFowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and\\r\\nsheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\\r\\nstate within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\\r\\nopen doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\\r\\nvast. There was an earthly savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the\\r\\nplace, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\\r\\ncandle-light, and not too much to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the\\r\\nback of the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\\r\\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\\r\\ndesks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and\\r\\nScrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as\\r\\nhe had used to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\\r\\nbehind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the\\r\\ndull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent\\r\\npoplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a\\r\\nclicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening\\r\\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\\r\\nintent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments: wonderfully\\r\\nreal and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe\\r\\nstuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, it\\'s Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. \"It\\'s dear old\\r\\nhonest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time when yonder\\r\\nsolitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first\\r\\ntime, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his\\r\\nwild brother, Orson; there they go! And what\\'s his name, who was put\\r\\ndown in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don\\'t you see him?\\r\\nAnd the Sultan\\'s Groom turned upside down by the Genii: there he is upon\\r\\nhis head! Serve him right! I\\'m glad of it. What business had _he_ to be\\r\\nmarried to the Princess?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\\r\\nsubjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and\\r\\nto see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to\\r\\nhis business friends in the City, indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: _\"Why, it\\'s Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy.\\r\\n\"It\\'s dear old honest Ali Baba.\"_]\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There\\'s the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge. \"Green body and yellow tail, with\\r\\na thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!\\r\\nPoor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing\\r\\nround the island. \\'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\\r\\nCrusoe?\\' The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn\\'t. It was the\\r\\nParrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little\\r\\ncreek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,\\r\\nhe said, in pity for his former self, \"Poor boy!\" and cried again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking\\r\\nabout him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: \"but it\\'s too late now.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" said Scrooge. \"Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas\\r\\nCarol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:\\r\\nthat\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying, as it did so,\\r\\n\"Let us see another Christmas!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge\\'s former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\\r\\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\\r\\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were\\r\\nshown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more\\r\\nthan you do. He only knew that it was quite correct: that everything had\\r\\nhappened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had\\r\\ngone home for the jolly holidays.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly. Scrooge\\r\\nlooked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced\\r\\nanxiously towards the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting\\r\\nin, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him,\\r\\naddressed him as her \"dear, dear brother.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!\" said the child, clapping\\r\\nher tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. \"To bring you home, home,\\r\\nhome!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Home, little Fan?\" returned the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes!\" said the child, brimful of glee. \"Home for good and all. Home for\\r\\never and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home\\'s\\r\\nlike Heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to\\r\\nbed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home;\\r\\nand he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you. And\\r\\nyou\\'re to be a man!\" said the child, opening her eyes; \"and are never to\\r\\ncome back here; but first we\\'re to be together all the Christmas long,\\r\\nand have the merriest time in all the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are quite a woman, little Fan!\" exclaimed the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but,\\r\\nbeing too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.\\r\\nThen she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door;\\r\\nand he, nothing loath to go, accompanied her.\\r\\n\\r\\nA terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master Scrooge\\'s box,\\r\\nthere!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on\\r\\nMaster Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a\\r\\ndreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him\\r\\nand his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour\\r\\nthat ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and\\r\\nterrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced\\r\\na decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,\\r\\nand administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at\\r\\nthe same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of\\r\\n\"something\" to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman,\\r\\nbut, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.\\r\\nMaster Scrooge\\'s trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the\\r\\nchaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly;\\r\\nand, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick\\r\\nwheels dashing the hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the\\r\\nevergreens like spray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,\" said\\r\\nthe Ghost. \"But she had a large heart!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So she had,\" cried Scrooge. \"You\\'re right. I will not gainsay it,\\r\\nSpirit. God forbid!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think, children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One child,\" Scrooge returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"True,\" said the Ghost. \"Your nephew!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, \"Yes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were\\r\\nnow in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed\\r\\nand repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and\\r\\nall the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough,\\r\\nby the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time\\r\\nagain; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he\\r\\nknew it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Know it!\" said Scrooge. \"Was I apprenticed here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting\\r\\nbehind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller, he must\\r\\nhave knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great\\r\\nexcitement:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, it\\'s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it\\'s Fezziwig alive again!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which\\r\\npointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his\\r\\ncapacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his\\r\\norgan of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat,\\r\\njovial voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScrooge\\'s former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in,\\r\\naccompanied by his fellow-\\'prentice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost. \"Bless me, yes.\\r\\nThere he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear,\\r\\ndear!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yo ho, my boys!\" said Fezziwig. \"No more work to-night. Christmas-eve,\\r\\nDick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let\\'s have the shutters up,\" cried old\\r\\nFezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands, \"before a man can say Jack\\r\\nRobinson!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou wouldn\\'t believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into\\r\\nthe street with the shutters--one, two, three--had \\'em up in their\\r\\nplaces--four, five, six--barred \\'em and pinned \\'em--seven, eight,\\r\\nnine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like\\r\\nrace-horses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hilli-ho!\" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with\\r\\nwonderful agility. \"Clear away, my lads, and let\\'s have lots of room\\r\\nhere! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nClear away! There was nothing they wouldn\\'t have cleared away, or\\r\\ncouldn\\'t have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in\\r\\na minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from\\r\\npublic life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps\\r\\nwere trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as\\r\\nsnug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room as you would desire to\\r\\nsee upon a winter\\'s night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and\\r\\nmade an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomachaches. In came Mrs.\\r\\nFezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs,\\r\\nbeaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they\\r\\nbroke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In\\r\\ncame the housemaid, with her cousin the baker. In came the cook, with\\r\\nher brother\\'s particular friend the milkman. In came the boy from over\\r\\nthe way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master;\\r\\ntrying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was\\r\\nproved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came,\\r\\none after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some\\r\\nawkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and\\r\\nevery how. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round\\r\\nand back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and\\r\\nround in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always\\r\\nturning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as soon\\r\\nas they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help\\r\\nthem! When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his\\r\\nhands to stop the dance, cried out, \"Well done!\" and the fiddler plunged\\r\\nhis hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose.\\r\\nBut, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again,\\r\\nthough there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been\\r\\ncarried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man\\r\\nresolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and\\r\\nthere was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold\\r\\nRoast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were\\r\\nmince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came\\r\\nafter the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The\\r\\nsort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told\\r\\nit him!) struck up \"Sir Roger de Coverley.\" Then old Fezziwig stood out\\r\\nto dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of\\r\\nwork cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people\\r\\nwho were not to be trifled with; people who _would_ dance, and had no\\r\\nnotion of walking.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if they had been twice as many--ah! four times--old Fezziwig would\\r\\nhave been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to _her_, she\\r\\nwas worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that\\'s not\\r\\nhigh praise, tell me higher, and I\\'ll use it. A positive light appeared\\r\\nto issue from Fezziwig\\'s calves. They shone in every part of the dance\\r\\nlike moons. You couldn\\'t have predicted, at any given time, what would\\r\\nbecome of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone\\r\\nall through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner,\\r\\nbow and curtsy, cork-screw, thread-the-needle, and back again to your\\r\\nplace; Fezziwig \"cut\"--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his\\r\\nlegs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nFezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking\\r\\nhands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him\\r\\nor her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two\\r\\n\\'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died\\r\\naway, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter\\r\\nin the back-shop.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his\\r\\nwits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He\\r\\ncorroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and\\r\\nunderwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright\\r\\nfaces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he\\r\\nremembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon\\r\\nhim, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly folks so full of\\r\\ngratitude.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were\\r\\npouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and, when he had done\\r\\nso, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:\\r\\nthree or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It isn\\'t that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking\\r\\nunconsciously like his former, not his latter self. \"It isn\\'t that,\\r\\nSpirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our\\r\\nservice light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power\\r\\nlies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it\\r\\nis impossible to add and count \\'em up: what then? The happiness he gives\\r\\nis quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe felt the Spirit\\'s glance, and stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" said Scrooge, \"no. I should like to be able to say a word or two\\r\\nto my clerk just now. That\\'s all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish;\\r\\nand Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but\\r\\nit produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was\\r\\nolder now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and\\r\\nrigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care\\r\\nand avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,\\r\\nwhich showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of\\r\\nthe growing tree would fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning\\r\\ndress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that\\r\\nshone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It matters little,\" she said softly. \"To you, very little. Another idol\\r\\nhas displaced me; and, if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come\\r\\nas I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What Idol has displaced you?\" he rejoined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A golden one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\" he said. \"There is\\r\\nnothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it\\r\\nprofesses to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You fear the world too much,\" she answered gently. \"All your other\\r\\nhopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid\\r\\nreproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until\\r\\nthe master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What then?\" he retorted. \"Even if I have grown so much wiser, what\\r\\nthen? I am not changed towards you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Am I?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor, and\\r\\ncontent to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly\\r\\nfortune by our patient industry. You _are_ changed. When it was made you\\r\\nwere another man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was a boy,\" he said impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,\" she\\r\\nreturned. \"I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart\\r\\nis fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I\\r\\nhave thought of this I will not say. It is enough that I _have_ thought\\r\\nof it, and can release you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have I ever sought release?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In words. No. Never.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In what, then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of\\r\\nlife; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of\\r\\nany worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,\"\\r\\nsaid the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him, \"tell me,\\r\\nwould you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of\\r\\nhimself. But he said, with a struggle, \"You think not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would gladly think otherwise if I could,\" she answered. \"Heaven\\r\\nknows! When _I_ have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and\\r\\nirresistible it must be. But if you were free to-day, to-morrow,\\r\\nyesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless\\r\\ngirl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by\\r\\nGain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your\\r\\none guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and\\r\\nregret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With a full heart,\\r\\nfor the love of him you once were.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was about to speak; but, with her head turned from him, she resumed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have\\r\\npain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the\\r\\nrecollection of it gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it\\r\\nhappened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have\\r\\nchosen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left him, and they parted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, \"show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you\\r\\ndelight to torture me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One shadow more!\" exclaimed the Ghost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No more!\" cried Scrooge. \"No more! I don\\'t wish to see it. Show me no\\r\\nmore!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him\\r\\nto observe what happened next.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or\\r\\nhandsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful\\r\\nyoung girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same,\\r\\nuntil he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\\r\\nThe noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more\\r\\nchildren there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;\\r\\nand, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty\\r\\nchildren conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting\\r\\nitself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but\\r\\nno one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed\\r\\nheartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to\\r\\nmingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most\\r\\nruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I\\r\\nnever could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn\\'t for the wealth of all\\r\\nthe world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and, for the\\r\\nprecious little shoe, I wouldn\\'t have plucked it off, God bless my soul!\\r\\nto save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold\\r\\nyoung brood, I couldn\\'t have done it; I should have expected my arm to\\r\\nhave grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And\\r\\nyet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have\\r\\nquestioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the\\r\\nlashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose\\r\\nwaves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in\\r\\nshort, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest\\r\\nlicence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately\\r\\nensued that she, with laughing face and plundered dress, was borne\\r\\ntowards it in the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time\\r\\nto greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with\\r\\nChristmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and\\r\\nthe onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him,\\r\\nwith chairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of\\r\\nbrown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round the\\r\\nneck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The\\r\\nshouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package\\r\\nwas received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in\\r\\nthe act of putting a doll\\'s frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than\\r\\nsuspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden\\r\\nplatter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and\\r\\ngratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough\\r\\nthat by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the parlour,\\r\\nand, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where they went\\r\\nto bed, and so subsided.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of\\r\\nthe house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her\\r\\nand her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such\\r\\nanother creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have\\r\\ncalled him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his\\r\\nlife, his sight grew very dim indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Belle,\" said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, \"I saw an\\r\\nold friend of yours this afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who was it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Guess!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can I? Tut, don\\'t I know?\" she added in the same breath, laughing\\r\\nas he laughed. \"Mr. Scrooge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut\\r\\nup, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His\\r\\npartner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.\\r\\nQuite alone in the world, I do believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Spirit!\" said Scrooge in a broken voice, \"remove me from this place.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,\" said the\\r\\nGhost. \"That they are what they are, do not blame me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remove me!\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"I cannot bear it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face\\r\\nin which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it\\r\\nhad shown him, wrestled with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Leave me! Take me back! Haunt me no longer!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the struggle--if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost,\\r\\nwith no visible resistance on its own part, was undisturbed by any\\r\\neffort of its adversary--Scrooge observed that its light was burning\\r\\nhigh and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him,\\r\\nhe seized the extinguisher cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down\\r\\nupon its head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its\\r\\nwhole form; but, though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he\\r\\ncould not hide the light, which streamed from under it in an unbroken\\r\\nflood upon the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible\\r\\ndrowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a\\r\\nparting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel\\r\\nto bed before he sank into a heavy sleep.\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeffLEAK HOUSE\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chancery\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting\\r\\nin Lincoln\\'s Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in\\r\\nthe streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of\\r\\nthe earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus,\\r\\nforty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn\\r\\nHill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black\\r\\ndrizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown\\r\\nsnowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of\\r\\nthe sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better;\\r\\nsplashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one\\r\\nanother\\'s umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing\\r\\ntheir foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other\\r\\nfoot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke\\r\\n(if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust\\r\\nof mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and\\r\\naccumulating at compound interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and\\r\\nmeadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers\\r\\nof shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.\\r\\nFog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping\\r\\ninto the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and\\r\\nhovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales\\r\\nof barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient\\r\\nGreenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog\\r\\nin the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,\\r\\ndown in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of\\r\\nhis shivering little \\'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the\\r\\nbridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog\\r\\nall round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the\\r\\nmisty clouds.\\r\\n\\r\\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as\\r\\nthe sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman\\r\\nand ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their\\r\\ntime--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling\\r\\nlook.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the\\r\\nmuddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction,\\r\\nappropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old\\r\\ncorporation, Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln\\'s Inn\\r\\nHall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in\\r\\nhis High Court of Chancery.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire\\r\\ntoo deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which\\r\\nthis High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds\\r\\nthis day in the sight of heaven and earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be\\r\\nsitting here--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head,\\r\\nsoftly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a\\r\\nlarge advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an\\r\\ninterminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the\\r\\nlantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog. On such an\\r\\nafternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar\\r\\nought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the ten\\r\\nthousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on\\r\\nslippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running\\r\\ntheir goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and\\r\\nmaking a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players might. On\\r\\nsuch an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, some two or\\r\\nthree of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a\\r\\nfortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a line, in a\\r\\nlong matted well (but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom\\r\\nof it) between the registrar\\'s red table and the silk gowns, with\\r\\nbills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits,\\r\\nissues, references to masters, masters\\' reports, mountains of costly\\r\\nnonsense, piled before them. Well may the court be dim, with wasting\\r\\ncandles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it\\r\\nwould never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their\\r\\ncolour and admit no light of day into the place; well may the\\r\\nuninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in\\r\\nthe door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the\\r\\ndrawl, languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the\\r\\nLord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it\\r\\nand where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank! This is the\\r\\nCourt of Chancery, which has its decaying houses and its blighted\\r\\nlands in every shire, which has its worn-out lunatic in every\\r\\nmadhouse and its dead in every churchyard, which has its ruined\\r\\nsuitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and\\r\\nbegging through the round of every man\\'s acquaintance, which gives to\\r\\nmonied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right, which so\\r\\nexhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain\\r\\nand breaks the heart, that there is not an honourable man among its\\r\\npractitioners who would not give--who does not often give--the\\r\\nwarning, \"Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come\\r\\nhere!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWho happen to be in the Lord Chancellor\\'s court this murky afternoon\\r\\nbesides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three\\r\\ncounsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before\\r\\nmentioned? There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown;\\r\\nand there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or\\r\\nwhatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning,\\r\\nfor no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the\\r\\ncause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The\\r\\nshort-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of\\r\\nthe newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when\\r\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing on\\r\\na seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained\\r\\nsanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is\\r\\nalways in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting\\r\\nsome incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour. Some say\\r\\nshe really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for\\r\\ncertain because no one cares. She carries some small litter in a\\r\\nreticule which she calls her documents, principally consisting of\\r\\npaper matches and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come up, in\\r\\ncustody, for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application \"to\\r\\npurge himself of his contempt,\" which, being a solitary surviving\\r\\nexecutor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts\\r\\nof which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is\\r\\nnot at all likely ever to do. In the meantime his prospects in life\\r\\nare ended. Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from\\r\\nShropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at\\r\\nthe close of the day\\'s business and who can by no means be made to\\r\\nunderstand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence\\r\\nafter making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself\\r\\nin a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out \"My\\r\\nLord!\" in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising.\\r\\nA few lawyers\\' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger\\r\\non the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal\\r\\nweather a little.\\r\\n\\r\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in\\r\\ncourse of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it\\r\\nmeans. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been\\r\\nobserved that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five\\r\\nminutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the\\r\\npremises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause;\\r\\ninnumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people\\r\\nhave died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found\\r\\nthemselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how\\r\\nor why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the\\r\\nsuit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new\\r\\nrocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown\\r\\nup, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the\\r\\nother world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and\\r\\ngrandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone\\r\\nout; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere\\r\\nbills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth\\r\\nperhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a\\r\\ncoffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags\\r\\nits dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.\\r\\n\\r\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke. That is the only good\\r\\nthat has ever come of it. It has been death to many, but it is a joke\\r\\nin the profession. Every master in Chancery has had a reference out\\r\\nof it. Every Chancellor was \"in it,\" for somebody or other, when he\\r\\nwas counsel at the bar. Good things have been said about it by\\r\\nblue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee\\r\\nafter dinner in hall. Articled clerks have been in the habit of\\r\\nfleshing their legal wit upon it. The last Lord Chancellor handled it\\r\\nneatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said\\r\\nthat such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he\\r\\nobserved, \"or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr.\\r\\nBlowers\"--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and\\r\\npurses.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched\\r\\nforth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide\\r\\nquestion. From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty\\r\\nwarrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many\\r\\nshapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks\\' Office who has\\r\\ncopied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that\\r\\neternal heading, no man\\'s nature has been made better by it. In\\r\\ntrickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under\\r\\nfalse pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never\\r\\ncome to good. The very solicitors\\' boys who have kept the wretched\\r\\nsuitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle,\\r\\nMizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments\\r\\nuntil dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into\\r\\nthemselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause\\r\\nhas acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a\\r\\ndistrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind. Chizzle,\\r\\nMizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising\\r\\nthemselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter\\r\\nand see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when\\r\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and\\r\\nsharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the\\r\\nill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history\\r\\nfrom the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted\\r\\ninto a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad\\r\\ncourse, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some\\r\\noff-hand manner never meant to go right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the\\r\\nLord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mr. Tangle,\" says the Lord High Chancellor, latterly something\\r\\nrestless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mlud,\" says Mr. Tangle. Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and\\r\\nJarndyce than anybody. He is famous for it--supposed never to have\\r\\nread anything else since he left school.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you nearly concluded your argument?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mlud, no--variety of points--feel it my duty tsubmit--ludship,\" is\\r\\nthe reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?\" says\\r\\nthe Chancellor with a slight smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighteen of Mr. Tangle\\'s learned friends, each armed with a little\\r\\nsummary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a\\r\\npianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places\\r\\nof obscurity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,\" says the\\r\\nChancellor. For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a\\r\\nmere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come\\r\\nto a settlement one of these days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner is brought forward\\r\\nin a hurry; the man from Shropshire cries, \"My lord!\" Maces, bags,\\r\\nand purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from\\r\\nShropshire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In reference,\" proceeds the Chancellor, still on Jarndyce and\\r\\nJarndyce, \"to the young girl--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--boy,\" says Mr. Tangle prematurely. \"In\\r\\nreference,\" proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, \"to the\\r\\nyoung girl and boy, the two young people\"--Mr. Tangle crushed--\"whom\\r\\nI directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private\\r\\nroom, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of\\r\\nmaking the order for their residing with their uncle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tangle on his legs again. \"Begludship\\'s pardon--dead.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With their\"--Chancellor looking through his double eye-glass at the\\r\\npapers on his desk--\"grandfather.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--victim of rash action--brains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises,\\r\\nfully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, \"Will\\r\\nyour lordship allow me? I appear for him. He is a cousin, several\\r\\ntimes removed. I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in\\r\\nwhat exact remove he is a cousin, but he IS a cousin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral message) ringing in\\r\\nthe rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the fog\\r\\nknows him no more. Everybody looks for him. Nobody can see him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will speak with both the young people,\" says the Chancellor anew,\\r\\n\"and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their\\r\\ncousin. I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my\\r\\nseat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is\\r\\npresented. Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner\\'s conglomeration\\r\\nbut his being sent back to prison, which is soon done. The man from\\r\\nShropshire ventures another remonstrative \"My lord!\" but the\\r\\nChancellor, being aware of him, has dexterously vanished. Everybody\\r\\nelse quickly vanishes too. A battery of blue bags is loaded with\\r\\nheavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks; the little mad old\\r\\nwoman marches off with her documents; the empty court is locked up.\\r\\nIf all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has\\r\\ncaused could only be locked up with it, and the whole burnt away in a\\r\\ngreat funeral pyre--why so much the better for other parties than the\\r\\nparties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Fashion\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same\\r\\nmiry afternoon. It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we\\r\\nmay pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow flies. Both the\\r\\nworld of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of precedent\\r\\nand usage: oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who have played at strange\\r\\ngames through a deal of thundery weather; sleeping beauties whom the\\r\\nknight will wake one day, when all the stopped spits in the kitchen\\r\\nshall begin to turn prodigiously!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not a large world. Relatively even to this world of ours, which\\r\\nhas its limits too (as your Highness shall find when you have made\\r\\nthe tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond), it is a\\r\\nvery little speck. There is much good in it; there are many good and\\r\\ntrue people in it; it has its appointed place. But the evil of it is\\r\\nthat it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller\\'s cotton and fine\\r\\nwool, and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds, and cannot\\r\\nsee them as they circle round the sun. It is a deadened world, and\\r\\nits growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days\\r\\nprevious to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to\\r\\nstay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain. The\\r\\nfashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians,\\r\\nand it knows all fashionable things. To know things otherwise were to\\r\\nbe unfashionable. My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in\\r\\nfamiliar conversation, her \"place\" in Lincolnshire. The waters are\\r\\nout in Lincolnshire. An arch of the bridge in the park has been\\r\\nsapped and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile\\r\\nin breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in\\r\\nit and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.\\r\\nMy Lady Dedlock\\'s place has been extremely dreary. The weather for\\r\\nmany a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through,\\r\\nand the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman\\'s axe can make no\\r\\ncrash or crackle as they fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave\\r\\nquagmires where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in\\r\\nthe moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards\\r\\nthe green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the\\r\\nfalling rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock\\'s own windows is\\r\\nalternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink. The vases\\r\\non the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and\\r\\nthe heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged\\r\\npavement, called from old time the Ghost\\'s Walk, all night. On\\r\\nSundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit\\r\\nbreaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste\\r\\nas of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves. My Lady Dedlock (who is\\r\\nchildless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a\\r\\nkeeper\\'s lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed\\r\\npanes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a\\r\\nwoman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a\\r\\nwrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of\\r\\ntemper. My Lady Dedlock says she has been \"bored to death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in\\r\\nLincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the\\r\\nrabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants. The pictures\\r\\nof the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp\\r\\nwalls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along\\r\\nthe old rooms shutting up the shutters. And when they will next come\\r\\nforth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, like the fiend, is\\r\\nomniscient of the past and present, but not the future--cannot yet\\r\\nundertake to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier\\r\\nbaronet than he. His family is as old as the hills, and infinitely\\r\\nmore respectable. He has a general opinion that the world might get\\r\\non without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks. He would on\\r\\nthe whole admit nature to be a good idea (a little low, perhaps, when\\r\\nnot enclosed with a park-fence), but an idea dependent for its\\r\\nexecution on your great county families. He is a gentleman of strict\\r\\nconscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on\\r\\nthe shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather\\r\\nthan give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity. He is\\r\\nan honourable, obstinate, truthful, high-spirited, intensely\\r\\nprejudiced, perfectly unreasonable man.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady. He\\r\\nwill never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet\\r\\nsixty-seven. He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a\\r\\nlittle stiffly. He is of a worthy presence, with his light-grey hair\\r\\nand whiskers, his fine shirt-frill, his pure-white waistcoat, and his\\r\\nblue coat with bright buttons always buttoned. He is ceremonious,\\r\\nstately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and holds her\\r\\npersonal attractions in the highest estimation. His gallantry to my\\r\\nLady, which has never changed since he courted her, is the one little\\r\\ntouch of romantic fancy in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, he married her for love. A whisper still goes about that she\\r\\nhad not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that\\r\\nperhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more. But she had\\r\\nbeauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough to\\r\\nportion out a legion of fine ladies. Wealth and station, added to\\r\\nthese, soon floated her upward, and for years now my Lady Dedlock has\\r\\nbeen at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of\\r\\nthe fashionable tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer, everybody\\r\\nknows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having\\r\\nbeen rather frequently mentioned. My Lady Dedlock, having conquered\\r\\nHER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the freezing,\\r\\nmood. An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an equanimity of\\r\\nfatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the\\r\\ntrophies of her victory. She is perfectly well-bred. If she could be\\r\\ntranslated to heaven to-morrow, she might be expected to ascend\\r\\nwithout any rapture.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet\\r\\nin its autumn. She has a fine face--originally of a character that\\r\\nwould be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into\\r\\nclassicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state. Her\\r\\nfigure is elegant and has the effect of being tall. Not that she is\\r\\nso, but that \"the most is made,\" as the Honourable Bob Stables has\\r\\nfrequently asserted upon oath, \"of all her points.\" The same\\r\\nauthority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in\\r\\ncommendation of her hair especially that she is the best-groomed\\r\\nwoman in the whole stud.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up\\r\\nfrom her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable\\r\\nintelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her\\r\\ndeparture for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks,\\r\\nafter which her movements are uncertain. And at her house in town,\\r\\nupon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old-fashioned\\r\\nold gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of\\r\\nChancery, who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the\\r\\nDedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name\\r\\noutside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror\\'s\\r\\ntrick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set. Across\\r\\nthe hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the\\r\\nrooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of\\r\\nit--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman\\r\\nis conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady\\'s presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made\\r\\ngood thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic\\r\\nwills, and to be very rich. He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of\\r\\nfamily confidences, of which he is known to be the silent depository.\\r\\nThere are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of\\r\\nparks among the growing timber and the fern, which perhaps hold fewer\\r\\nnoble secrets than walk abroad among men, shut up in the breast of\\r\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. He is of what is called the old school--a phrase\\r\\ngenerally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and\\r\\nwears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings. One\\r\\npeculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings, be they\\r\\nsilk or worsted, is that they never shine. Mute, close, irresponsive\\r\\nto any glancing light, his dress is like himself. He never converses\\r\\nwhen not professionally consulted. He is found sometimes, speechless\\r\\nbut quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country\\r\\nhouses and near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the\\r\\nfashionable intelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him and\\r\\nwhere half the Peerage stops to say \"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\"\\r\\nHe receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with\\r\\nthe rest of his knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr.\\r\\nTulkinghorn. There is an air of prescription about him which is\\r\\nalways agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of\\r\\ntribute. He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s dress; there is a kind of tribute\\r\\nin that too. It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general\\r\\nway, retainer-like. It expresses, as it were, the steward of the\\r\\nlegal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHas Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself? It may be so, or it may\\r\\nnot, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in\\r\\neverything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as one\\r\\nof the leaders and representatives of her little world. She supposes\\r\\nherself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of\\r\\nordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks\\r\\nso. Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to\\r\\nthe manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices,\\r\\nfollies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a\\r\\ncalculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her\\r\\ndressmaker takes of her physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new\\r\\ncustom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new\\r\\ndwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are\\r\\ndeferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects\\r\\nof nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage\\r\\nher as if she were a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their\\r\\nlives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience,\\r\\nlead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook\\r\\nall and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet\\r\\nof the majestic Lilliput. \"If you want to address our people, sir,\"\\r\\nsay Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady\\r\\nDedlock and the rest--\"you must remember that you are not dealing\\r\\nwith the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest\\r\\nplace, and their weakest place is such a place.\" \"To make this\\r\\narticle go down, gentlemen,\" say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to\\r\\ntheir friends the manufacturers, \"you must come to us, because we\\r\\nknow where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it\\r\\nfashionable.\" \"If you want to get this print upon the tables of my\\r\\nhigh connexion, sir,\" says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, \"or if you\\r\\nwant to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion,\\r\\nsir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of\\r\\nmy high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for\\r\\nI have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion,\\r\\nsir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my\\r\\nfinger\"--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not\\r\\nexaggerate at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the\\r\\nDedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he may.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My Lady\\'s cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr.\\r\\nTulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes. It has been on again to-day,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, making\\r\\none of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire,\\r\\nshading her face with a hand-screen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It would be useless to ask,\" says my Lady with the dreariness of the\\r\\nplace in Lincolnshire still upon her, \"whether anything has been\\r\\ndone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,\" replies\\r\\nMr. Tulkinghorn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nor ever will be,\" says my Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit. It\\r\\nis a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing. To be\\r\\nsure, he has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her part\\r\\nin which was the only property my Lady brought him; and he has a\\r\\nshadowy impression that for his name--the name of Dedlock--to be in a\\r\\ncause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most ridiculous\\r\\naccident. But he regards the Court of Chancery, even if it should\\r\\ninvolve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of\\r\\nconfusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of\\r\\nother somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal\\r\\nsettlement (humanly speaking) of everything. And he is upon the whole\\r\\nof a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to\\r\\nany complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the\\r\\nlower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat Tyler.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,\" says Mr.\\r\\nTulkinghorn, \"and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the\\r\\ntroublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any\\r\\nnew proceedings in a cause\"--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no\\r\\nmore responsibility than necessary--\"and further, as I see you are\\r\\ngoing to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight of\\r\\nthe fashionable intelligence was in his Lady.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission to place them\\r\\non a golden talisman of a table at my Lady\\'s elbow, puts on his\\r\\nspectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'In Chancery. Between John Jarndyce--\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Lady interrupts, requesting him to miss as many of the formal\\r\\nhorrors as he can.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower\\r\\ndown. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir\\r\\nLeicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a\\r\\nstately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging\\r\\namong the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my\\r\\nLady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful,\\r\\nbeing priceless but small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the\\r\\npapers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks at them nearer\\r\\nstill--asks impulsively, \"Who copied that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised by my Lady\\'s animation and her\\r\\nunusual tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is it what you people call law-hand?\" she asks, looking full at him\\r\\nin her careless way again and toying with her screen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite. Probably\"--Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks--\"the\\r\\nlegal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was\\r\\nformed. Why do you ask?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Anything to vary this detestable monotony. Oh, go on, do!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tulkinghorn reads again. The heat is greater; my Lady screens her\\r\\nface. Sir Leicester dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, \"Eh? What\\r\\ndo you say?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I say I am afraid,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who had risen hastily,\\r\\n\"that Lady Dedlock is ill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Faint,\" my Lady murmurs with white lips, \"only that; but it is like\\r\\nthe faintness of death. Don\\'t speak to me. Ring, and take me to my\\r\\nroom!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber; bells ring, feet\\r\\nshuffle and patter, silence ensues. Mercury at last begs Mr.\\r\\nTulkinghorn to return.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better now,\" quoth Sir Leicester, motioning the lawyer to sit down\\r\\nand read to him alone. \"I have been quite alarmed. I never knew my\\r\\nLady swoon before. But the weather is extremely trying, and she\\r\\nreally has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire.\"\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeffDAVID COPPERFIELD\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE OF DAVID COPPERFIELD THE YOUNGER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 1. I AM BORN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that\\r\\nstation will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my\\r\\nlife with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have\\r\\nbeen informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o’clock at night.\\r\\nIt was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry,\\r\\nsimultaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by\\r\\nthe nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a\\r\\nlively interest in me several months before there was any possibility\\r\\nof our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be\\r\\nunlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and\\r\\nspirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to\\r\\nall unlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a\\r\\nFriday night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show\\r\\nbetter than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified\\r\\nby the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only remark,\\r\\nthat unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still\\r\\na baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all complain of\\r\\nhaving been kept out of this property; and if anybody else should be in\\r\\nthe present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to keep it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the\\r\\nnewspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going\\r\\npeople were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and\\r\\npreferred cork jackets, I don’t know; all I know is, that there was but\\r\\none solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the\\r\\nbill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance\\r\\nin sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher\\r\\nbargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead\\r\\nloss--for as to sherry, my poor dear mother’s own sherry was in the\\r\\nmarket then--and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle\\r\\ndown in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a\\r\\nhead, the winner to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I\\r\\nremember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of\\r\\nmyself being disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by\\r\\nan old lady with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it\\r\\nthe stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny\\r\\nshort--as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to\\r\\nendeavour without any effect to prove to her. It is a fact which will\\r\\nbe long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned,\\r\\nbut died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it\\r\\nwas, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the\\r\\nwater in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which\\r\\nshe was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation\\r\\nat the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go\\r\\n‘meandering’ about the world. It was in vain to represent to her\\r\\nthat some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this\\r\\nobjectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and\\r\\nwith an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, ‘Let us\\r\\nhave no meandering.’\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or ‘there by’, as they say in\\r\\nScotland. I was a posthumous child. My father’s eyes had closed upon\\r\\nthe light of this world six months, when mine opened on it. There is\\r\\nsomething strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw\\r\\nme; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have\\r\\nof my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the\\r\\nchurchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it\\r\\nlying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour\\r\\nwas warm and bright with fire and candle, and the doors of our house\\r\\nwere--almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes--bolted and locked\\r\\nagainst it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aunt of my father’s, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of whom\\r\\nI shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate of our\\r\\nfamily. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always called\\r\\nher, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable\\r\\npersonage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married\\r\\nto a husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the\\r\\nsense of the homely adage, ‘handsome is, that handsome does’--for he\\r\\nwas strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having\\r\\nonce, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined\\r\\narrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs’ window. These\\r\\nevidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him\\r\\noff, and effect a separation by mutual consent. He went to India with\\r\\nhis capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he was\\r\\nonce seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but I think\\r\\nit must have been a Baboo--or a Begum. Anyhow, from India tidings of his\\r\\ndeath reached home, within ten years. How they affected my aunt, nobody\\r\\nknew; for immediately upon the separation, she took her maiden name\\r\\nagain, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off,\\r\\nestablished herself there as a single woman with one servant, and\\r\\nwas understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible\\r\\nretirement.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father had once been a favourite of hers, I believe; but she was\\r\\nmortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was ‘a\\r\\nwax doll’. She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be not\\r\\nyet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. He was double\\r\\nmy mother’s age when he married, and of but a delicate constitution. He\\r\\ndied a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came\\r\\ninto the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be\\r\\nexcused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no\\r\\nclaim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood; or to\\r\\nhave any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what\\r\\nfollows.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low in\\r\\nspirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about\\r\\nherself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by\\r\\nsome grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer upstairs, to a world not at\\r\\nall excited on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting\\r\\nby the fire, that bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and\\r\\nvery doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her,\\r\\nwhen, lifting her eyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she\\r\\nsaw a strange lady coming up the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was\\r\\nMiss Betsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the\\r\\ngarden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity\\r\\nof figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to\\r\\nnobody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity.\\r\\nMy father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any\\r\\nordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and\\r\\nlooked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against\\r\\nthe glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became\\r\\nperfectly flat and white in a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I am\\r\\nindebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in\\r\\nthe corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly,\\r\\nbegan on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen’s Head\\r\\nin a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown\\r\\nand a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed, to\\r\\ncome and open the door. My mother went.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,’ said Miss Betsey; the emphasis\\r\\nreferring, perhaps, to my mother’s mourning weeds, and her condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said my mother, faintly.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Miss Trotwood,’ said the visitor. ‘You have heard of her, I dare say?’\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a disagreeable\\r\\nconsciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering\\r\\npleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now you see her,’ said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and begged\\r\\nher to walk in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went into the parlour my mother had come from, the fire in the best\\r\\nroom on the other side of the passage not being lighted--not having\\r\\nbeen lighted, indeed, since my father’s funeral; and when they were both\\r\\nseated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to\\r\\nrestrain herself, began to cry. ‘Oh tut, tut, tut!’ said Miss Betsey, in\\r\\na hurry. ‘Don’t do that! Come, come!’\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother couldn’t help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had\\r\\nhad her cry out.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Take off your cap, child,’ said Miss Betsey, ‘and let me see you.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd\\r\\nrequest, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore she did as she\\r\\nwas told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was\\r\\nluxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Why, bless my heart!’ exclaimed Miss Betsey. ‘You are a very Baby!’\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even for her\\r\\nyears; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing, and said,\\r\\nsobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow, and\\r\\nwould be but a childish mother if she lived. In a short pause which\\r\\nensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair, and\\r\\nthat with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid hope, she\\r\\nfound that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up, her hands\\r\\nfolded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning at the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘In the name of Heaven,’ said Miss Betsey, suddenly, ‘why Rookery?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Do you mean the house, ma’am?’ asked my mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Why Rookery?’ said Miss Betsey. ‘Cookery would have been more to the\\r\\npurpose, if you had had any practical ideas of life, either of you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The name was Mr. Copperfield’s choice,’ returned my mother. ‘When he\\r\\nbought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks about it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall old\\r\\nelm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor Miss\\r\\nBetsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms bent to one another,\\r\\nlike giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such\\r\\nrepose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if\\r\\ntheir late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind,\\r\\nsome weatherbeaten ragged old rooks’-nests, burdening their higher\\r\\nbranches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Where are the birds?’ asked Miss Betsey.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The--?’ My mother had been thinking of something else.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The rooks--what has become of them?’ asked Miss Betsey.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There have not been any since we have lived here,’ said my mother. ‘We\\r\\nthought--Mr. Copperfield thought--it was quite a large rookery; but\\r\\nthe nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a long\\r\\nwhile.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘David Copperfield all over!’ cried Miss Betsey. ‘David Copperfield from\\r\\nhead to foot! Calls a house a rookery when there’s not a rook near it,\\r\\nand takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Mr. Copperfield,’ returned my mother, ‘is dead, and if you dare to\\r\\nspeak unkindly of him to me--’\\r\\n\\r\\nMy poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention of\\r\\ncommitting an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have\\r\\nsettled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far better\\r\\ntraining for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed\\r\\nwith the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very\\r\\nmeekly, and fainted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her,\\r\\nwhichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The\\r\\ntwilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as they\\r\\nsaw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well?’ said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only\\r\\nbeen taking a casual look at the prospect; ‘and when do you expect--’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I am all in a tremble,’ faltered my mother. ‘I don’t know what’s the\\r\\nmatter. I shall die, I am sure!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No, no, no,’ said Miss Betsey. ‘Have some tea.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good?’ cried my\\r\\nmother in a helpless manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Of course it will,’ said Miss Betsey. ‘It’s nothing but fancy. What do\\r\\nyou call your girl?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t know that it will be a girl, yet, ma’am,’ said my mother\\r\\ninnocently.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Bless the Baby!’ exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting the\\r\\nsecond sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs, but\\r\\napplying it to my mother instead of me, ‘I don’t mean that. I mean your\\r\\nservant-girl.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Peggotty,’ said my mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Peggotty!’ repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation. ‘Do you mean to\\r\\nsay, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian church,\\r\\nand got herself named Peggotty?’ ‘It’s her surname,’ said my mother,\\r\\nfaintly. ‘Mr. Copperfield called her by it, because her Christian name\\r\\nwas the same as mine.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Here! Peggotty!’ cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlour door. ‘Tea.\\r\\nYour mistress is a little unwell. Don’t dawdle.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been\\r\\na recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house,\\r\\nand having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the\\r\\npassage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey shut\\r\\nthe door again, and sat down as before: with her feet on the fender, the\\r\\nskirt of her dress tucked up, and her hands folded on one knee.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You were speaking about its being a girl,’ said Miss Betsey. ‘I have no\\r\\ndoubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a girl.\\r\\nNow child, from the moment of the birth of this girl--’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Perhaps boy,’ my mother took the liberty of putting in.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl,’ returned Miss\\r\\nBetsey. ‘Don’t contradict. From the moment of this girl’s birth, child,\\r\\nI intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, and I beg\\r\\nyou’ll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must be no mistakes\\r\\nin life with THIS Betsey Trotwood. There must be no trifling with HER\\r\\naffections, poor dear. She must be well brought up, and well guarded\\r\\nfrom reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved. I\\r\\nmust make that MY care.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a twitch of Miss Betsey’s head, after each of these sentences,\\r\\nas if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any\\r\\nplainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected,\\r\\nat least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire: too\\r\\nmuch scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and\\r\\nbewildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what\\r\\nto say.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And was David good to you, child?’ asked Miss Betsey, when she had been\\r\\nsilent for a little while, and these motions of her head had gradually\\r\\nceased. ‘Were you comfortable together?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We were very happy,’ said my mother. ‘Mr. Copperfield was only too good\\r\\nto me.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What, he spoilt you, I suppose?’ returned Miss Betsey.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world\\r\\nagain, yes, I fear he did indeed,’ sobbed my mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well! Don’t cry!’ said Miss Betsey. ‘You were not equally matched,\\r\\nchild--if any two people can be equally matched--and so I asked the\\r\\nquestion. You were an orphan, weren’t you?’ ‘Yes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And a governess?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to\\r\\nvisit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of\\r\\nnotice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed\\r\\nto me. And I accepted him. And so we were married,’ said my mother\\r\\nsimply.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ha! Poor Baby!’ mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon the\\r\\nfire. ‘Do you know anything?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I beg your pardon, ma’am,’ faltered my mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘About keeping house, for instance,’ said Miss Betsey.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not much, I fear,’ returned my mother. ‘Not so much as I could wish.\\r\\nBut Mr. Copperfield was teaching me--’\\r\\n\\r\\n[‘Much he knew about it himself!’) said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis.\\r\\n--‘And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn, and\\r\\nhe very patient to teach me, if the great misfortune of his death’--my\\r\\nmother broke down again here, and could get no farther.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, well!’ said Miss Betsey. --‘I kept my housekeeping-book\\r\\nregularly, and balanced it with Mr. Copperfield every night,’ cried my\\r\\nmother in another burst of distress, and breaking down again.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, well!’ said Miss Betsey. ‘Don’t cry any more.’ --‘And I am\\r\\nsure we never had a word of difference respecting it, except when Mr.\\r\\nCopperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each\\r\\nother, or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines,’ resumed my\\r\\nmother in another burst, and breaking down again.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You’ll make yourself ill,’ said Miss Betsey, ‘and you know that will\\r\\nnot be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come! You mustn’t do\\r\\nit!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThis argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her\\r\\nincreasing indisposition had a larger one. There was an interval of\\r\\nsilence, only broken by Miss Betsey’s occasionally ejaculating ‘Ha!’ as\\r\\nshe sat with her feet upon the fender.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,’ said\\r\\nshe, by and by. ‘What did he do for you?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Mr. Copperfield,’ said my mother, answering with some difficulty, ‘was\\r\\nso considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to\\r\\nme.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘How much?’ asked Miss Betsey.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A hundred and five pounds a year,’ said my mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘He might have done worse,’ said my aunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much worse\\r\\nthat Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and seeing at a\\r\\nglance how ill she was,--as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if there\\r\\nhad been light enough,--conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all\\r\\nspeed; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew, who had been\\r\\nfor some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my mother, as a\\r\\nspecial messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse and doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived\\r\\nwithin a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of\\r\\nportentous appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied\\r\\nover her left arm, stopping her ears with jewellers’ cotton. Peggotty\\r\\nknowing nothing about her, and my mother saying nothing about her,\\r\\nshe was quite a mystery in the parlour; and the fact of her having a\\r\\nmagazine of jewellers’ cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article\\r\\nin her ears in that way, did not detract from the solemnity of her\\r\\npresence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor having been upstairs and come down again, and having\\r\\nsatisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this\\r\\nunknown lady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for some\\r\\nhours, laid himself out to be polite and social. He was the meekest of\\r\\nhis sex, the mildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to\\r\\ntake up the less space. He walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet,\\r\\nand more slowly. He carried his head on one side, partly in modest\\r\\ndepreciation of himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody\\r\\nelse. It is nothing to say that he hadn’t a word to throw at a dog. He\\r\\ncouldn’t have thrown a word at a mad dog. He might have offered him one\\r\\ngently, or half a one, or a fragment of one; for he spoke as slowly as\\r\\nhe walked; but he wouldn’t have been rude to him, and he couldn’t have\\r\\nbeen quick with him, for any earthly consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side, and\\r\\nmaking her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers’ cotton, as\\r\\nhe softly touched his left ear:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Some local irritation, ma’am?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What!’ replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness--as he told my mother\\r\\nafterwards--that it was a mercy he didn’t lose his presence of mind. But\\r\\nhe repeated sweetly:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Some local irritation, ma’am?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nonsense!’ replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly,\\r\\nas she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called upstairs again.\\r\\nAfter some quarter of an hour’s absence, he returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well?’ said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, ma’am,’ returned Mr. Chillip, ‘we are--we are progressing slowly,\\r\\nma’am.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ba--a--ah!’ said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous\\r\\ninterjection. And corked herself as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nReally--really--as Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked;\\r\\nspeaking in a professional point of view alone, he was almost shocked.\\r\\nBut he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours,\\r\\nas she sat looking at the fire, until he was again called out. After\\r\\nanother absence, he again returned.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well?’ said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, ma’am,’ returned Mr. Chillip, ‘we are--we are progressing slowly,\\r\\nma’am.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ya--a--ah!’ said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. Chillip\\r\\nabsolutely could not bear it. It was really calculated to break his\\r\\nspirit, he said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs,\\r\\nin the dark and a strong draught, until he was again sent for.\\r\\n\\r\\nHam Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very dragon at\\r\\nhis catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness,\\r\\nreported next day, that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour\\r\\nafter this, he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey, then walking to\\r\\nand fro in a state of agitation, and pounced upon before he could make\\r\\nhis escape. That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices\\r\\noverhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude, from the\\r\\ncircumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on\\r\\nwhom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest.\\r\\nThat, marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had\\r\\nbeen taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled\\r\\nhis hair, made light of his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded\\r\\nthem with her own, and otherwise tousled and maltreated him. This was\\r\\nin part confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half past twelve o’clock,\\r\\nsoon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if\\r\\nat any time. He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty,\\r\\nand said to my aunt in his meekest manner:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, ma’am, I am happy to congratulate you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What upon?’ said my aunt, sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Chillip was fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt’s\\r\\nmanner; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to\\r\\nmollify her.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Mercy on the man, what’s he doing!’ cried my aunt, impatiently. ‘Can’t\\r\\nhe speak?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Be calm, my dear ma’am,’ said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma’am. Be calm.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn’t shake\\r\\nhim, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook her own\\r\\nhead at him, but in a way that made him quail.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, ma’am,’ resumed Mr. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, ‘I am\\r\\nhappy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma’am, and well over.’\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery\\r\\nof this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘How is she?’ said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet still tied\\r\\non one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, ma’am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope,’ returned Mr.\\r\\nChillip. ‘Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be,\\r\\nunder these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot be any\\r\\nobjection to your seeing her presently, ma’am. It may do her good.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And SHE. How is SHE?’ said my aunt, sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my\\r\\naunt like an amiable bird.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The baby,’ said my aunt. ‘How is she?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ma’am,’ returned Mr. Chillip, ‘I apprehended you had known. It’s a\\r\\nboy.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMy aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in the\\r\\nmanner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip’s head with it, put it on\\r\\nbent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a discontented\\r\\nfairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it was popularly\\r\\nsupposed I was entitled to see; and never came back any more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey\\r\\nTrotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows, the\\r\\ntremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the light upon\\r\\nthe window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such\\r\\ntravellers, and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he,\\r\\nwithout whom I had never been.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 2. I OBSERVE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look\\r\\nfar back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty\\r\\nhair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so\\r\\ndark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face,\\r\\nand cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn’t\\r\\npeck her in preference to apples.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed\\r\\nto my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going\\r\\nunsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind\\r\\nwhich I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of\\r\\nPeggotty’s forefinger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its being\\r\\nroughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go\\r\\nfarther back into such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe\\r\\nthe power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite\\r\\nwonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that most\\r\\ngrown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater propriety\\r\\nbe said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it; the\\r\\nrather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness,\\r\\nand gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an\\r\\ninheritance they have preserved from their childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nI might have a misgiving that I am ‘meandering’ in stopping to say this,\\r\\nbut that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in part\\r\\nupon my own experience of myself; and if it should appear from\\r\\nanything I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close\\r\\nobservation, or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood, I\\r\\nundoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first\\r\\nobjects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of\\r\\nthings, are my mother and Peggotty. What else do I remember? Let me see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere comes out of the cloud, our house--not new to me, but quite\\r\\nfamiliar, in its earliest remembrance. On the ground-floor is Peggotty’s\\r\\nkitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in\\r\\nthe centre, without any pigeons in it; a great dog-kennel in a corner,\\r\\nwithout any dog; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me,\\r\\nwalking about, in a menacing and ferocious manner. There is one cock who\\r\\ngets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of me as\\r\\nI look at him through the kitchen window, who makes me shiver, he is so\\r\\nfierce. Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after\\r\\nme with their long necks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at\\r\\nnight: as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a long passage--what an enormous perspective I make of\\r\\nit!--leading from Peggotty’s kitchen to the front door. A dark\\r\\nstore-room opens out of it, and that is a place to be run past at\\r\\nnight; for I don’t know what may be among those tubs and jars and old\\r\\ntea-chests, when there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light,\\r\\nletting a mouldy air come out of the door, in which there is the smell\\r\\nof soap, pickles, pepper, candles, and coffee, all at one whiff. Then\\r\\nthere are the two parlours: the parlour in which we sit of an evening,\\r\\nmy mother and I and Peggotty--for Peggotty is quite our companion, when\\r\\nher work is done and we are alone--and the best parlour where we sit\\r\\non a Sunday; grandly, but not so comfortably. There is something of a\\r\\ndoleful air about that room to me, for Peggotty has told me--I don’t\\r\\nknow when, but apparently ages ago--about my father’s funeral, and the\\r\\ncompany having their black cloaks put on. One Sunday night my mother\\r\\nreads to Peggotty and me in there, how Lazarus was raised up from the\\r\\ndead. And I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me\\r\\nout of bed, and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window,\\r\\nwith the dead all lying in their graves at rest, below the solemn moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of\\r\\nthat churchyard; nothing half so shady as its trees; nothing half so\\r\\nquiet as its tombstones. The sheep are feeding there, when I kneel up,\\r\\nearly in the morning, in my little bed in a closet within my mother’s\\r\\nroom, to look out at it; and I see the red light shining on the\\r\\nsun-dial, and think within myself, ‘Is the sun-dial glad, I wonder, that\\r\\nit can tell the time again?’\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With a window\\r\\nnear it, out of which our house can be seen, and IS seen many times\\r\\nduring the morning’s service, by Peggotty, who likes to make herself\\r\\nas sure as she can that it’s not being robbed, or is not in flames. But\\r\\nthough Peggotty’s eye wanders, she is much offended if mine does,\\r\\nand frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am to look at the\\r\\nclergyman. But I can’t always look at him--I know him without that white\\r\\nthing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and perhaps\\r\\nstopping the service to inquire--and what am I to do? It’s a dreadful\\r\\nthing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my mother, but she\\r\\npretends not to see me. I look at a boy in the aisle, and he makes faces\\r\\nat me. I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through\\r\\nthe porch, and there I see a stray sheep--I don’t mean a sinner, but\\r\\nmutton--half making up his mind to come into the church. I feel that\\r\\nif I looked at him any longer, I might be tempted to say something out\\r\\nloud; and what would become of me then! I look up at the monumental\\r\\ntablets on the wall, and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this\\r\\nparish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been, when\\r\\naffliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physicians were in\\r\\nvain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain;\\r\\nand if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week. I look from\\r\\nMr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit; and think what a\\r\\ngood place it would be to play in, and what a castle it would make, with\\r\\nanother boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and having the velvet\\r\\ncushion with the tassels thrown down on his head. In time my eyes\\r\\ngradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a\\r\\ndrowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I fall off the seat with\\r\\na crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive, by Peggotty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed\\r\\nbedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the\\r\\nragged old rooks’-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom\\r\\nof the front garden. Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond the\\r\\nyard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are--a very preserve\\r\\nof butterflies, as I remember it, with a high fence, and a gate and\\r\\npadlock; where the fruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer than\\r\\nfruit has ever been since, in any other garden, and where my\\r\\nmother gathers some in a basket, while I stand by, bolting furtive\\r\\ngooseberries, and trying to look unmoved. A great wind rises, and the\\r\\nsummer is gone in a moment. We are playing in the winter twilight,\\r\\ndancing about the parlour. When my mother is out of breath and rests\\r\\nherself in an elbow-chair, I watch her winding her bright curls round\\r\\nher fingers, and straitening her waist, and nobody knows better than I\\r\\ndo that she likes to look so well, and is proud of being so pretty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is among my very earliest impressions. That, and a sense that we\\r\\nwere both a little afraid of Peggotty, and submitted ourselves in most\\r\\nthings to her direction, were among the first opinions--if they may be\\r\\nso called--that I ever derived from what I saw.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeggotty and I were sitting one night by the parlour fire, alone. I\\r\\nhad been reading to Peggotty about crocodiles. I must have read very\\r\\nperspicuously, or the poor soul must have been deeply interested, for I\\r\\nremember she had a cloudy impression, after I had done, that they were\\r\\na sort of vegetable. I was tired of reading, and dead sleepy; but\\r\\nhaving leave, as a high treat, to sit up until my mother came home from\\r\\nspending the evening at a neighbour’s, I would rather have died upon\\r\\nmy post (of course) than have gone to bed. I had reached that stage of\\r\\nsleepiness when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large.\\r\\nI propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers, and looked\\r\\nperseveringly at her as she sat at work; at the little bit of wax-candle\\r\\nshe kept for her thread--how old it looked, being so wrinkled in\\r\\nall directions!--at the little house with a thatched roof, where the\\r\\nyard-measure lived; at her work-box with a sliding lid, with a view of\\r\\nSt. Paul’s Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted on the top; at the brass\\r\\nthimble on her finger; at herself, whom I thought lovely. I felt so\\r\\nsleepy, that I knew if I lost sight of anything for a moment, I was\\r\\ngone.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Peggotty,’ says I, suddenly, ‘were you ever married?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Lord, Master Davy,’ replied Peggotty. ‘What’s put marriage in your\\r\\nhead?’\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered with such a start, that it quite awoke me. And then she\\r\\nstopped in her work, and looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its\\r\\nthread’s length.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But WERE you ever married, Peggotty?’ says I. ‘You are a very handsome\\r\\nwoman, an’t you?’\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought her in a different style from my mother, certainly; but of\\r\\nanother school of beauty, I considered her a perfect example. There\\r\\nwas a red velvet footstool in the best parlour, on which my mother\\r\\nhad painted a nosegay. The ground-work of that stool, and Peggotty’s\\r\\ncomplexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing. The stool was\\r\\nsmooth, and Peggotty was rough, but that made no difference.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Me handsome, Davy!’ said Peggotty. ‘Lawk, no, my dear! But what put\\r\\nmarriage in your head?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I don’t know!--You mustn’t marry more than one person at a time, may\\r\\nyou, Peggotty?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Certainly not,’ says Peggotty, with the promptest decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But if you marry a person, and the person dies, why then you may marry\\r\\nanother person, mayn’t you, Peggotty?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘YOU MAY,’ says Peggotty, ‘if you choose, my dear. That’s a matter of\\r\\nopinion.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But what is your opinion, Peggotty?’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked her, and looked curiously at her, because she looked so\\r\\ncuriously at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My opinion is,’ said Peggotty, taking her eyes from me, after a little\\r\\nindecision and going on with her work, ‘that I never was married myself,\\r\\nMaster Davy, and that I don’t expect to be. That’s all I know about the\\r\\nsubject.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You an’t cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you?’ said I, after sitting\\r\\nquiet for a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really thought she was, she had been so short with me; but I was quite\\r\\nmistaken: for she laid aside her work (which was a stocking of her own),\\r\\nand opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and gave it\\r\\na good squeeze. I know it was a good squeeze, because, being very plump,\\r\\nwhenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed, some of the\\r\\nbuttons on the back of her gown flew off. And I recollect two bursting\\r\\nto the opposite side of the parlour, while she was hugging me.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now let me hear some more about the Crorkindills,’ said Peggotty, who\\r\\nwas not quite right in the name yet, ‘for I an’t heard half enough.’\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn’t quite understand why Peggotty looked so queer, or why she\\r\\nwas so ready to go back to the crocodiles. However, we returned to those\\r\\nmonsters, with fresh wakefulness on my part, and we left their eggs in\\r\\nthe sand for the sun to hatch; and we ran away from them, and baffled\\r\\nthem by constantly turning, which they were unable to do quickly, on\\r\\naccount of their unwieldy make; and we went into the water after them,\\r\\nas natives, and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats; and in\\r\\nshort we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet. I did, at least; but I had\\r\\nmy doubts of Peggotty, who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into\\r\\nvarious parts of her face and arms, all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had exhausted the crocodiles, and begun with the alligators, when\\r\\nthe garden-bell rang. We went out to the door; and there was my mother,\\r\\nlooking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman with\\r\\nbeautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from\\r\\nchurch last Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and\\r\\nkiss me, the gentleman said I was a more highly privileged little fellow\\r\\nthan a monarch--or something like that; for my later understanding\\r\\ncomes, I am sensible, to my aid here.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What does that mean?’ I asked him, over her shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe patted me on the head; but somehow, I didn’t like him or his deep\\r\\nvoice, and I was jealous that his hand should touch my mother’s in\\r\\ntouching me--which it did. I put it away, as well as I could.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh, Davy!’ remonstrated my mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Dear boy!’ said the gentleman. ‘I cannot wonder at his devotion!’\\r\\n\\r\\nI never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother’s face before. She\\r\\ngently chid me for being rude; and, keeping me close to her shawl,\\r\\nturned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her\\r\\nhome. She put out her hand to him as she spoke, and, as he met it with\\r\\nhis own, she glanced, I thought, at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Let us say “good night”, my fine boy,’ said the gentleman, when he had\\r\\nbent his head--I saw him!--over my mother’s little glove.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Good night!’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Come! Let us be the best friends in the world!’ said the gentleman,\\r\\nlaughing. ‘Shake hands!’\\r\\n\\r\\nMy right hand was in my mother’s left, so I gave him the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Why, that’s the Wrong hand, Davy!’ laughed the gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother drew my right hand forward, but I was resolved, for my former\\r\\nreason, not to give it him, and I did not. I gave him the other, and he\\r\\nshook it heartily, and said I was a brave fellow, and went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us a last\\r\\nlook with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was shut.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeggotty, who had not said a word or moved a finger, secured the\\r\\nfastenings instantly, and we all went into the parlour. My mother,\\r\\ncontrary to her usual habit, instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the\\r\\nfire, remained at the other end of the room, and sat singing to herself.\\r\\n--‘Hope you have had a pleasant evening, ma’am,’ said Peggotty, standing\\r\\nas stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room, with a candlestick in\\r\\nher hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Much obliged to you, Peggotty,’ returned my mother, in a cheerful\\r\\nvoice, ‘I have had a VERY pleasant evening.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A stranger or so makes an agreeable change,’ suggested Peggotty.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A very agreeable change, indeed,’ returned my mother.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room, and\\r\\nmy mother resuming her singing, I fell asleep, though I was not so sound\\r\\nasleep but that I could hear voices, without hearing what they said.\\r\\nWhen I half awoke from this uncomfortable doze, I found Peggotty and my\\r\\nmother both in tears, and both talking.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not such a one as this, Mr. Copperfield wouldn’t have liked,’ said\\r\\nPeggotty. ‘That I say, and that I swear!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Good Heavens!’ cried my mother, ‘you’ll drive me mad! Was ever any\\r\\npoor girl so ill-used by her servants as I am! Why do I do myself\\r\\nthe injustice of calling myself a girl? Have I never been married,\\r\\nPeggotty?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘God knows you have, ma’am,’ returned Peggotty. ‘Then, how can you\\r\\ndare,’ said my mother--‘you know I don’t mean how can you dare,\\r\\nPeggotty, but how can you have the heart--to make me so uncomfortable\\r\\nand say such bitter things to me, when you are well aware that I\\r\\nhaven’t, out of this place, a single friend to turn to?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The more’s the reason,’ returned Peggotty, ‘for saying that it won’t\\r\\ndo. No! That it won’t do. No! No price could make it do. No!’--I thought\\r\\nPeggotty would have thrown the candlestick away, she was so emphatic\\r\\nwith it.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘How can you be so aggravating,’ said my mother, shedding more tears\\r\\nthan before, ‘as to talk in such an unjust manner! How can you go on as\\r\\nif it was all settled and arranged, Peggotty, when I tell you over\\r\\nand over again, you cruel thing, that beyond the commonest civilities\\r\\nnothing has passed! You talk of admiration. What am I to do? If people\\r\\nare so silly as to indulge the sentiment, is it my fault? What am I to\\r\\ndo, I ask you? Would you wish me to shave my head and black my face, or\\r\\ndisfigure myself with a burn, or a scald, or something of that sort? I\\r\\ndare say you would, Peggotty. I dare say you’d quite enjoy it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nPeggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart, I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And my dear boy,’ cried my mother, coming to the elbow-chair in which\\r\\nI was, and caressing me, ‘my own little Davy! Is it to be hinted to me\\r\\nthat I am wanting in affection for my precious treasure, the dearest\\r\\nlittle fellow that ever was!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nobody never went and hinted no such a thing,’ said Peggotty.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You did, Peggotty!’ returned my mother. ‘You know you did. What else\\r\\nwas it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature,\\r\\nwhen you know as well as I do, that on his account only last quarter I\\r\\nwouldn’t buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is frayed\\r\\nthe whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy? You know it is,\\r\\nPeggotty. You can’t deny it.’ Then, turning affectionately to me, with\\r\\nher cheek against mine, ‘Am I a naughty mama to you, Davy? Am I a nasty,\\r\\ncruel, selfish, bad mama? Say I am, my child; say “yes”, dear boy, and\\r\\nPeggotty will love you; and Peggotty’s love is a great deal better than\\r\\nmine, Davy. I don’t love you at all, do I?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this, we all fell a-crying together. I think I was the loudest of\\r\\nthe party, but I am sure we were all sincere about it. I was quite\\r\\nheart-broken myself, and am afraid that in the first transports of\\r\\nwounded tenderness I called Peggotty a ‘Beast’. That honest creature was\\r\\nin deep affliction, I remember, and must have become quite buttonless\\r\\non the occasion; for a little volley of those explosives went off,\\r\\nwhen, after having made it up with my mother, she kneeled down by the\\r\\nelbow-chair, and made it up with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to bed greatly dejected. My sobs kept waking me, for a long\\r\\ntime; and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed, I found\\r\\nmy mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over me. I fell asleep in\\r\\nher arms, after that, and slept soundly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether it was the following Sunday when I saw the gentleman again,\\r\\nor whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared,\\r\\nI cannot recall. I don’t profess to be clear about dates. But there he\\r\\nwas, in church, and he walked home with us afterwards. He came in, too,\\r\\nto look at a famous geranium we had, in the parlour-window. It did not\\r\\nappear to me that he took much notice of it, but before he went he asked\\r\\nmy mother to give him a bit of the blossom. She begged him to choose it\\r\\nfor himself, but he refused to do that--I could not understand why--so\\r\\nshe plucked it for him, and gave it into his hand. He said he would\\r\\nnever, never part with it any more; and I thought he must be quite a\\r\\nfool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeggotty began to be less with us, of an evening, than she had always\\r\\nbeen. My mother deferred to her very much--more than usual, it occurred\\r\\nto me--and we were all three excellent friends; still we were different\\r\\nfrom what we used to be, and were not so comfortable among ourselves.\\r\\nSometimes I fancied that Peggotty perhaps objected to my mother’s\\r\\nwearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers, or to her\\r\\ngoing so often to visit at that neighbour’s; but I couldn’t, to my\\r\\nsatisfaction, make out how it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black\\r\\nwhiskers. I liked him no better than at first, and had the same uneasy\\r\\njealousy of him; but if I had any reason for it beyond a child’s\\r\\ninstinctive dislike, and a general idea that Peggotty and I could make\\r\\nmuch of my mother without any help, it certainly was not THE reason that\\r\\nI might have found if I had been older. No such thing came into my mind,\\r\\nor near it. I could observe, in little pieces, as it were; but as to\\r\\nmaking a net of a number of these pieces, and catching anybody in it,\\r\\nthat was, as yet, beyond me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne autumn morning I was with my mother in the front garden, when Mr.\\r\\nMurdstone--I knew him by that name now--came by, on horseback. He reined\\r\\nup his horse to salute my mother, and said he was going to Lowestoft to\\r\\nsee some friends who were there with a yacht, and merrily proposed to\\r\\ntake me on the saddle before him if I would like the ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air was so clear and pleasant, and the horse seemed to like the\\r\\nidea of the ride so much himself, as he stood snorting and pawing at the\\r\\ngarden-gate, that I had a great desire to go. So I was sent upstairs\\r\\nto Peggotty to be made spruce; and in the meantime Mr. Murdstone\\r\\ndismounted, and, with his horse’s bridle drawn over his arm, walked\\r\\nslowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence, while my\\r\\nmother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company. I\\r\\nrecollect Peggotty and I peeping out at them from my little window; I\\r\\nrecollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between\\r\\nthem, as they strolled along; and how, from being in a perfectly angelic\\r\\ntemper, Peggotty turned cross in a moment, and brushed my hair the wrong\\r\\nway, excessively hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the green turf\\r\\nby the side of the road. He held me quite easily with one arm, and I\\r\\ndon’t think I was restless usually; but I could not make up my mind to\\r\\nsit in front of him without turning my head sometimes, and looking up in\\r\\nhis face. He had that kind of shallow black eye--I want a better word to\\r\\nexpress an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into--which, when\\r\\nit is abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured,\\r\\nfor a moment at a time, by a cast. Several times when I glanced at him,\\r\\nI observed that appearance with a sort of awe, and wondered what he\\r\\nwas thinking about so closely. His hair and whiskers were blacker and\\r\\nthicker, looked at so near, than even I had given them credit for being.\\r\\nA squareness about the lower part of his face, and the dotted indication\\r\\nof the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me of\\r\\nthe wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year\\r\\nbefore. This, his regular eyebrows, and the rich white, and black, and\\r\\nbrown, of his complexion--confound his complexion, and his memory!--made\\r\\nme think him, in spite of my misgivings, a very handsome man. I have no\\r\\ndoubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to an hotel by the sea, where two gentlemen were smoking cigars\\r\\nin a room by themselves. Each of them was lying on at least four chairs,\\r\\nand had a large rough jacket on. In a corner was a heap of coats and\\r\\nboat-cloaks, and a flag, all bundled up together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner, when we\\r\\ncame in, and said, ‘Halloa, Murdstone! We thought you were dead!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not yet,’ said Mr. Murdstone.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And who’s this shaver?’ said one of the gentlemen, taking hold of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That’s Davy,’ returned Mr. Murdstone.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Davy who?’ said the gentleman. ‘Jones?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Copperfield,’ said Mr. Murdstone.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What! Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield’s encumbrance?’ cried the gentleman.\\r\\n‘The pretty little widow?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Quinion,’ said Mr. Murdstone, ‘take care, if you please. Somebody’s\\r\\nsharp.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Who is?’ asked the gentleman, laughing. I looked up, quickly; being\\r\\ncurious to know.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Only Brooks of Sheffield,’ said Mr. Murdstone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was quite relieved to find that it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for,\\r\\nat first, I really thought it was I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of Mr.\\r\\nBrooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he\\r\\nwas mentioned, and Mr. Murdstone was a good deal amused also. After some\\r\\nlaughing, the gentleman whom he had called Quinion, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And what is the opinion of Brooks of Sheffield, in reference to the\\r\\nprojected business?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Why, I don’t know that Brooks understands much about it at present,’\\r\\nreplied Mr. Murdstone; ‘but he is not generally favourable, I believe.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was more laughter at this, and Mr. Quinion said he would ring the\\r\\nbell for some sherry in which to drink to Brooks. This he did; and when\\r\\nthe wine came, he made me have a little, with a biscuit, and, before\\r\\nI drank it, stand up and say, ‘Confusion to Brooks of Sheffield!’ The\\r\\ntoast was received with great applause, and such hearty laughter that\\r\\nit made me laugh too; at which they laughed the more. In short, we quite\\r\\nenjoyed ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe walked about on the cliff after that, and sat on the grass, and\\r\\nlooked at things through a telescope--I could make out nothing myself\\r\\nwhen it was put to my eye, but I pretended I could--and then we came\\r\\nback to the hotel to an early dinner. All the time we were out, the two\\r\\ngentlemen smoked incessantly--which, I thought, if I might judge from\\r\\nthe smell of their rough coats, they must have been doing, ever since\\r\\nthe coats had first come home from the tailor’s. I must not forget that\\r\\nwe went on board the yacht, where they all three descended into the\\r\\ncabin, and were busy with some papers. I saw them quite hard at work,\\r\\nwhen I looked down through the open skylight. They left me, during this\\r\\ntime, with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very\\r\\nsmall shiny hat upon it, who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat\\r\\non, with ‘Skylark’ in capital letters across the chest. I thought it was\\r\\nhis name; and that as he lived on board ship and hadn’t a street door\\r\\nto put his name on, he put it there instead; but when I called him Mr.\\r\\nSkylark, he said it meant the vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nI observed all day that Mr. Murdstone was graver and steadier than the\\r\\ntwo gentlemen. They were very gay and careless. They joked freely with\\r\\none another, but seldom with him. It appeared to me that he was\\r\\nmore clever and cold than they were, and that they regarded him with\\r\\nsomething of my own feeling. I remarked that, once or twice when Mr.\\r\\nQuinion was talking, he looked at Mr. Murdstone sideways, as if to make\\r\\nsure of his not being displeased; and that once when Mr. Passnidge (the\\r\\nother gentleman) was in high spirits, he trod upon his foot, and gave\\r\\nhim a secret caution with his eyes, to observe Mr. Murdstone, who was\\r\\nsitting stern and silent. Nor do I recollect that Mr. Murdstone laughed\\r\\nat all that day, except at the Sheffield joke--and that, by the by, was\\r\\nhis own.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went home early in the evening. It was a very fine evening, and my\\r\\nmother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar, while I was sent in\\r\\nto get my tea. When he was gone, my mother asked me all about the day I\\r\\nhad had, and what they had said and done. I mentioned what they had said\\r\\nabout her, and she laughed, and told me they were impudent fellows who\\r\\ntalked nonsense--but I knew it pleased her. I knew it quite as well as\\r\\nI know it now. I took the opportunity of asking if she was at all\\r\\nacquainted with Mr. Brooks of Sheffield, but she answered No, only she\\r\\nsupposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan I say of her face--altered as I have reason to remember it, perished\\r\\nas I know it is--that it is gone, when here it comes before me at this\\r\\ninstant, as distinct as any face that I may choose to look on in a\\r\\ncrowded street? Can I say of her innocent and girlish beauty, that it\\r\\nfaded, and was no more, when its breath falls on my cheek now, as it\\r\\nfell that night? Can I say she ever changed, when my remembrance brings\\r\\nher back to life, thus only; and, truer to its loving youth than I have\\r\\nbeen, or man ever is, still holds fast what it cherished then?\\r\\n\\r\\nI write of her just as she was when I had gone to bed after this talk,\\r\\nand she came to bid me good night. She kneeled down playfully by the\\r\\nside of the bed, and laying her chin upon her hands, and laughing, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What was it they said, Davy? Tell me again. I can’t believe it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘“Bewitching--“’ I began.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It was never bewitching,’ she said, laughing. ‘It never could have been\\r\\nbewitching, Davy. Now I know it wasn’t!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes, it was. “Bewitching Mrs. Copperfield”,’ I repeated stoutly. ‘And,\\r\\n“pretty.”’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No, no, it was never pretty. Not pretty,’ interposed my mother, laying\\r\\nher fingers on my lips again.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes it was. “Pretty little widow.”’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What foolish, impudent creatures!’ cried my mother, laughing and\\r\\ncovering her face. ‘What ridiculous men! An’t they? Davy dear--’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, Ma.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Don’t tell Peggotty; she might be angry with them. I am dreadfully\\r\\nangry with them myself; but I would rather Peggotty didn’t know.’\\r\\n\\r\\nI promised, of course; and we kissed one another over and over again,\\r\\nand I soon fell fast asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems to me, at this distance of time, as if it were the next day\\r\\nwhen Peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition I am\\r\\nabout to mention; but it was probably about two months afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were sitting as before, one evening (when my mother was out as\\r\\nbefore), in company with the stocking and the yard-measure, and the bit\\r\\nof wax, and the box with St. Paul’s on the lid, and the crocodile book,\\r\\nwhen Peggotty, after looking at me several times, and opening her mouth\\r\\nas if she were going to speak, without doing it--which I thought was\\r\\nmerely gaping, or I should have been rather alarmed--said coaxingly:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Master Davy, how should you like to go along with me and spend a\\r\\nfortnight at my brother’s at Yarmouth? Wouldn’t that be a treat?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?’ I inquired, provisionally.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh, what an agreeable man he is!’ cried Peggotty, holding up her hands.\\r\\n‘Then there’s the sea; and the boats and ships; and the fishermen; and\\r\\nthe beach; and Am to play with--’\\r\\n\\r\\nPeggotty meant her nephew Ham, mentioned in my first chapter; but she\\r\\nspoke of him as a morsel of English Grammar.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was flushed by her summary of delights, and replied that it would\\r\\nindeed be a treat, but what would my mother say?\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Why then I’ll as good as bet a guinea,’ said Peggotty, intent upon my\\r\\nface, ‘that she’ll let us go. I’ll ask her, if you like, as soon as ever\\r\\nshe comes home. There now!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But what’s she to do while we’re away?’ said I, putting my small elbows\\r\\non the table to argue the point. ‘She can’t live by herself.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Peggotty were looking for a hole, all of a sudden, in the heel of\\r\\nthat stocking, it must have been a very little one indeed, and not worth\\r\\ndarning.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I say! Peggotty! She can’t live by herself, you know.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh, bless you!’ said Peggotty, looking at me again at last. ‘Don’t\\r\\nyou know? She’s going to stay for a fortnight with Mrs. Grayper. Mrs.\\r\\nGrayper’s going to have a lot of company.’\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! If that was it, I was quite ready to go. I waited, in the utmost\\r\\nimpatience, until my mother came home from Mrs. Grayper’s (for it was\\r\\nthat identical neighbour), to ascertain if we could get leave to carry\\r\\nout this great idea. Without being nearly so much surprised as I had\\r\\nexpected, my mother entered into it readily; and it was all arranged\\r\\nthat night, and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid\\r\\nfor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day soon came for our going. It was such an early day that it came\\r\\nsoon, even to me, who was in a fever of expectation, and half afraid\\r\\nthat an earthquake or a fiery mountain, or some other great convulsion\\r\\nof nature, might interpose to stop the expedition. We were to go in a\\r\\ncarrier’s cart, which departed in the morning after breakfast. I would\\r\\nhave given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night,\\r\\nand sleep in my hat and boots.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt touches me nearly now, although I tell it lightly, to recollect how\\r\\neager I was to leave my happy home; to think how little I suspected what\\r\\nI did leave for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad to recollect that when the carrier’s cart was at the gate, and\\r\\nmy mother stood there kissing me, a grateful fondness for her and for\\r\\nthe old place I had never turned my back upon before, made me cry. I am\\r\\nglad to know that my mother cried too, and that I felt her heart beat\\r\\nagainst mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move, my mother\\r\\nran out at the gate, and called to him to stop, that she might kiss me\\r\\nonce more. I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which\\r\\nshe lifted up her face to mine, and did so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we left her standing in the road, Mr. Murdstone came up to where\\r\\nshe was, and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved. I was\\r\\nlooking back round the awning of the cart, and wondered what business\\r\\nit was of his. Peggotty, who was also looking back on the other side,\\r\\nseemed anything but satisfied; as the face she brought back in the cart\\r\\ndenoted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat looking at Peggotty for some time, in a reverie on this\\r\\nsupposititious case: whether, if she were employed to lose me like the\\r\\nboy in the fairy tale, I should be able to track my way home again by\\r\\nthe buttons she would shed.\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeffHARD TIMES\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\nTHE ONE THING NEEDFUL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n‘NOW, what I want is, Facts.  Teach these boys and girls nothing but\\r\\nFacts.  Facts alone are wanted in life.  Plant nothing else, and root out\\r\\neverything else.  You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon\\r\\nFacts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them.  This is the\\r\\nprinciple on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle\\r\\non which I bring up these children.  Stick to Facts, sir!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a school-room, and the\\r\\nspeaker’s square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring\\r\\nevery sentence with a line on the schoolmaster’s sleeve.  The emphasis\\r\\nwas helped by the speaker’s square wall of a forehead, which had his\\r\\neyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two\\r\\ndark caves, overshadowed by the wall.  The emphasis was helped by the\\r\\nspeaker’s mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set.  The emphasis was\\r\\nhelped by the speaker’s voice, which was inflexible, dry, and\\r\\ndictatorial.  The emphasis was helped by the speaker’s hair, which\\r\\nbristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the\\r\\nwind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of\\r\\na plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts\\r\\nstored inside.  The speaker’s obstinate carriage, square coat, square\\r\\nlegs, square shoulders,—nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by\\r\\nthe throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it\\r\\nwas,—all helped the emphasis.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but Facts!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person present,\\r\\nall backed a little, and swept with their eyes the inclined plane of\\r\\nlittle vessels then and there arranged in order, ready to have imperial\\r\\ngallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\nMURDERING THE INNOCENTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHOMAS GRADGRIND, sir.  A man of realities.  A man of facts and\\r\\ncalculations.  A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are\\r\\nfour, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for\\r\\nanything over.  Thomas Gradgrind, sir—peremptorily Thomas—Thomas\\r\\nGradgrind.  With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication\\r\\ntable always in his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of\\r\\nhuman nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.  It is a mere\\r\\nquestion of figures, a case of simple arithmetic.  You might hope to get\\r\\nsome other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or\\r\\nAugustus Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all\\r\\nsupposititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of Thomas\\r\\nGradgrind—no, sir!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether\\r\\nto his private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general.  In\\r\\nsuch terms, no doubt, substituting the words ‘boys and girls,’ for ‘sir,’\\r\\nThomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers\\r\\nbefore him, who were to be filled so full of facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before\\r\\nmentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts,\\r\\nand prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one\\r\\ndischarge.  He seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim\\r\\nmechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be\\r\\nstormed away.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Girl number twenty,’ said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with his\\r\\nsquare forefinger, ‘I don’t know that girl.  Who is that girl?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Sissy Jupe, sir,’ explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and\\r\\ncurtseying.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Sissy is not a name,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Don’t call yourself Sissy.\\r\\nCall yourself Cecilia.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It’s father as calls me Sissy, sir,’ returned the young girl in a\\r\\ntrembling voice, and with another curtsey.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Then he has no business to do it,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘Tell him he\\r\\nmustn’t.  Cecilia Jupe.  Let me see.  What is your father?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling with his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We don’t want to know anything about that, here.  You mustn’t tell us\\r\\nabout that, here.  Your father breaks horses, don’t he?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do break horses\\r\\nin the ring, sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You mustn’t tell us about the ring, here.  Very well, then.  Describe\\r\\nyour father as a horsebreaker.  He doctors sick horses, I dare say?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh yes, sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very well, then.  He is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, and\\r\\nhorsebreaker.  Give me your definition of a horse.’\\r\\n\\r\\n(Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!’ said Mr. Gradgrind, for\\r\\nthe general behoof of all the little pitchers.  ‘Girl number twenty\\r\\npossessed of no facts, in reference to one of the commonest of animals!\\r\\nSome boy’s definition of a horse.  Bitzer, yours.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on Bitzer,\\r\\nperhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which,\\r\\ndarting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white-washed room,\\r\\nirradiated Sissy.  For, the boys and girls sat on the face of the\\r\\ninclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow\\r\\ninterval; and Sissy, being at the corner of a row on the sunny side, came\\r\\nin for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which Bitzer, being at the corner\\r\\nof a row on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught the end.  But,\\r\\nwhereas the girl was so dark-eyed and dark-haired, that she seemed to\\r\\nreceive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun, when it shone\\r\\nupon her, the boy was so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same\\r\\nrays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he ever possessed.\\r\\nHis cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends of\\r\\nlashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something\\r\\npaler than themselves, expressed their form.  His short-cropped hair\\r\\nmight have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead\\r\\nand face.  His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge,\\r\\nthat he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Bitzer,’ said Thomas Gradgrind.  ‘Your definition of a horse.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Quadruped.  Graminivorous.  Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders,\\r\\nfour eye-teeth, and twelve incisive.  Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy\\r\\ncountries, sheds hoofs, too.  Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with\\r\\niron.  Age known by marks in mouth.’  Thus (and much more) Bitzer.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now girl number twenty,’ said Mr. Gradgrind.  ‘You know what a horse\\r\\nis.’\\r\\n\\r\\nShe curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper, if she could have\\r\\nblushed deeper than she had blushed all this time.  Bitzer, after rapidly\\r\\nblinking at Thomas Gradgrind with both eyes at once, and so catching the\\r\\nlight upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antennæ\\r\\nof busy insects, put his knuckles to his freckled forehead, and sat down\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third gentleman now stepped forth.  A mighty man at cutting and\\r\\ndrying, he was; a government officer; in his way (and in most other\\r\\npeople’s too), a professed pugilist; always in training, always with a\\r\\nsystem to force down the general throat like a bolus, always to be heard\\r\\nof at the bar of his little Public-office, ready to fight all England.\\r\\nTo continue in fistic phraseology, he had a genius for coming up to the\\r\\nscratch, wherever and whatever it was, and proving himself an ugly\\r\\ncustomer.  He would go in and damage any subject whatever with his right,\\r\\nfollow up with his left, stop, exchange, counter, bore his opponent (he\\r\\nalways fought All England) to the ropes, and fall upon him neatly.  He\\r\\nwas certain to knock the wind out of common sense, and render that\\r\\nunlucky adversary deaf to the call of time.  And he had it in charge from\\r\\nhigh authority to bring about the great public-office Millennium, when\\r\\nCommissioners should reign upon earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very well,’ said this gentleman, briskly smiling, and folding his arms.\\r\\n‘That’s a horse.  Now, let me ask you girls and boys, Would you paper a\\r\\nroom with representations of horses?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a pause, one half of the children cried in chorus, ‘Yes, sir!’\\r\\nUpon which the other half, seeing in the gentleman’s face that Yes was\\r\\nwrong, cried out in chorus, ‘No, sir!’—as the custom is, in these\\r\\nexaminations.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Of course, No.  Why wouldn’t you?’\\r\\n\\r\\nA pause.  One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner of breathing,\\r\\nventured the answer, Because he wouldn’t paper a room at all, but would\\r\\npaint it.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You _must_ paper it,’ said the gentleman, rather warmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You must paper it,’ said Thomas Gradgrind, ‘whether you like it or not.\\r\\nDon’t tell _us_ you wouldn’t paper it.  What do you mean, boy?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I’ll explain to you, then,’ said the gentleman, after another and a\\r\\ndismal pause, ‘why you wouldn’t paper a room with representations of\\r\\nhorses.  Do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in\\r\\nreality—in fact?  Do you?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes, sir!’ from one half.  ‘No, sir!’ from the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Of course no,’ said the gentleman, with an indignant look at the wrong\\r\\nhalf.  ‘Why, then, you are not to see anywhere, what you don’t see in\\r\\nfact; you are not to have anywhere, what you don’t have in fact.  What is\\r\\ncalled Taste, is only another name for Fact.’  Thomas Gradgrind nodded\\r\\nhis approbation.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘This is a new principle, a discovery, a great discovery,’ said the\\r\\ngentleman.  ‘Now, I’ll try you again.  Suppose you were going to carpet a\\r\\nroom.  Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon\\r\\nit?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThere being a general conviction by this time that ‘No, sir!’ was always\\r\\nthe right answer to this gentleman, the chorus of NO was very strong.\\r\\nOnly a few feeble stragglers said Yes: among them Sissy Jupe.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Girl number twenty,’ said the gentleman, smiling in the calm strength of\\r\\nknowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSissy blushed, and stood up.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘So you would carpet your room—or your husband’s room, if you were a\\r\\ngrown woman, and had a husband—with representations of flowers, would\\r\\nyou?’ said the gentleman.  ‘Why would you?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,’ returned the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them, and have\\r\\npeople walking over them with heavy boots?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It wouldn’t hurt them, sir.  They wouldn’t crush and wither, if you\\r\\nplease, sir.  They would be the pictures of what was very pretty and\\r\\npleasant, and I would fancy—’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ay, ay, ay!  But you mustn’t fancy,’ cried the gentleman, quite elated\\r\\nby coming so happily to his point.  ‘That’s it!  You are never to fancy.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You are not, Cecilia Jupe,’ Thomas Gradgrind solemnly repeated, ‘to do\\r\\nanything of that kind.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Fact, fact, fact!’ said the gentleman.  And ‘Fact, fact, fact!’ repeated\\r\\nThomas Gradgrind.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You are to be in all things regulated and governed,’ said the gentleman,\\r\\n‘by fact.  We hope to have, before long, a board of fact, composed of\\r\\ncommissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact,\\r\\nand of nothing but fact.  You must discard the word Fancy altogether.\\r\\nYou have nothing to do with it.  You are not to have, in any object of\\r\\nuse or ornament, what would be a contradiction in fact.  You don’t walk\\r\\nupon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in\\r\\ncarpets.  You don’t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and\\r\\nperch upon your crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds\\r\\nand butterflies upon your crockery.  You never meet with quadrupeds going\\r\\nup and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls.\\r\\nYou must use,’ said the gentleman, ‘for all these purposes, combinations\\r\\nand modifications (in primary colours) of mathematical figures which are\\r\\nsusceptible of proof and demonstration.  This is the new discovery.  This\\r\\nis fact.  This is taste.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl curtseyed, and sat down.  She was very young, and she looked as\\r\\nif she were frightened by the matter-of-fact prospect the world afforded.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now, if Mr. M’Choakumchild,’ said the gentleman, ‘will proceed to give\\r\\nhis first lesson here, Mr. Gradgrind, I shall be happy, at your request,\\r\\nto observe his mode of procedure.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gradgrind was much obliged.  ‘Mr. M’Choakumchild, we only wait for\\r\\nyou.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, Mr. M’Choakumchild began in his best manner.  He and some one hundred\\r\\nand forty other schoolmasters, had been lately turned at the same time,\\r\\nin the same factory, on the same principles, like so many pianoforte\\r\\nlegs.  He had been put through an immense variety of paces, and had\\r\\nanswered volumes of head-breaking questions.

THE PICKWICKIANS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first ray of light which illumines the gloom, and converts into a\\r\\ndazzling brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the\\r\\npublic career of the immortal Pickwick would appear to be involved, is\\r\\nderived from the perusal of the following entry in the Transactions of\\r\\nthe Pickwick Club, which the editor of these papers feels the highest\\r\\npleasure in laying before his readers, as a proof of the careful\\r\\nattention, indefatigable assiduity, and nice discrimination, with which\\r\\nhis search among the multifarious documents confided to him has been\\r\\nconducted.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘May 12, 1827. Joseph Smiggers, Esq., P.V.P.M.P.C. [Perpetual Vice-\\r\\nPresident--Member Pickwick Club], presiding. The following resolutions\\r\\nunanimously agreed to:--\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That this Association has heard read, with feelings of unmingled\\r\\nsatisfaction, and unqualified approval, the paper communicated by Samuel\\r\\nPickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C. [General Chairman--Member Pickwick Club],\\r\\nentitled “Speculations on the Source of the Hampstead Ponds, with some\\r\\nObservations on the Theory of Tittlebats;” and that this Association\\r\\ndoes hereby return its warmest thanks to the said Samuel Pickwick, Esq.,\\r\\nG.C.M.P.C., for the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That while this Association is deeply sensible of the advantages which\\r\\nmust accrue to the cause of science, from the production to which they\\r\\nhave just adverted--no less than from the unwearied researches of Samuel\\r\\nPickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., in Hornsey, Highgate, Brixton, and\\r\\nCamberwell--they cannot but entertain a lively sense of the inestimable\\r\\nbenefits which must inevitably result from carrying the speculations of\\r\\nthat learned man into a wider field, from extending his travels, and,\\r\\nconsequently, enlarging his sphere of observation, to the advancement of\\r\\nknowledge, and the diffusion of learning.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That, with the view just mentioned, this Association has taken into its\\r\\nserious consideration a proposal, emanating from the aforesaid, Samuel\\r\\nPickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., and three other Pickwickians hereinafter\\r\\nnamed, for forming a new branch of United Pickwickians, under the title\\r\\nof The Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this\\r\\nAssociation.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That the Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club is therefore hereby\\r\\nconstituted; and that Samuel Pickwick, Esq., G.C.M.P.C., Tracy Tupman,\\r\\nEsq., M.P.C., Augustus Snodgrass, Esq., M.P.C., and Nathaniel Winkle,\\r\\nEsq., M.P.C., are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same;\\r\\nand that they be requested to forward, from time to time, authenticated\\r\\naccounts of their journeys and investigations, of their observations of\\r\\ncharacter and manners, and of the whole of their adventures, together\\r\\nwith all tales and papers to which local scenery or associations may\\r\\ngive rise, to the Pickwick Club, stationed in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That this Association cordially recognises the principle of every\\r\\nmember of the Corresponding Society defraying his own travelling\\r\\nexpenses; and that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the\\r\\nsaid society pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they\\r\\nplease, upon the same terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That the members of the aforesaid Corresponding Society be, and are\\r\\nhereby informed, that their proposal to pay the postage of their\\r\\nletters, and the carriage of their parcels, has been deliberated upon by\\r\\nthis Association: that this Association considers such proposal worthy\\r\\nof the great minds from which it emanated, and that it hereby signifies\\r\\nits perfect acquiescence therein.’\\r\\n\\r\\nA casual observer, adds the secretary, to whose notes we are indebted\\r\\nfor the following account--a casual observer might possibly have\\r\\nremarked nothing extraordinary in the bald head, and circular\\r\\nspectacles, which were intently turned towards his (the secretary’s)\\r\\nface, during the reading of the above resolutions: to those who knew\\r\\nthat the gigantic brain of Pickwick was working beneath that forehead,\\r\\nand that the beaming eyes of Pickwick were twinkling behind those\\r\\nglasses, the sight was indeed an interesting one. There sat the man who\\r\\nhad traced to their source the mighty ponds of Hampstead, and agitated\\r\\nthe scientific world with his Theory of Tittlebats, as calm and unmoved\\r\\nas the deep waters of the one on a frosty day, or as a solitary specimen\\r\\nof the other in the inmost recesses of an earthen jar. And how much more\\r\\ninteresting did the spectacle become, when, starting into full life and\\r\\nanimation, as a simultaneous call for ‘Pickwick’ burst from his\\r\\nfollowers, that illustrious man slowly mounted into the Windsor chair,\\r\\non which he had been previously seated, and addressed the club himself\\r\\nhad founded. What a study for an artist did that exciting scene present!\\r\\nThe eloquent Pickwick, with one hand gracefully concealed behind his\\r\\ncoat tails, and the other waving in air to assist his glowing\\r\\ndeclamation; his elevated position revealing those tights and gaiters,\\r\\nwhich, had they clothed an ordinary man, might have passed without\\r\\nobservation, but which, when Pickwick clothed them--if we may use the\\r\\nexpression--inspired involuntary awe and respect; surrounded by the men\\r\\nwho had volunteered to share the perils of his travels, and who were\\r\\ndestined to participate in the glories of his discoveries. On his right\\r\\nsat Mr. Tracy Tupman--the too susceptible Tupman, who to the wisdom and\\r\\nexperience of maturer years superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a\\r\\nboy in the most interesting and pardonable of human weaknesses--love.\\r\\nTime and feeding had expanded that once romantic form; the black silk\\r\\nwaistcoat had become more and more developed; inch by inch had the gold\\r\\nwatch-chain beneath it disappeared from within the range of Tupman’s\\r\\nvision; and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders\\r\\nof the white cravat: but the soul of Tupman had known no change--\\r\\nadmiration of the fair sex was still its ruling passion. On the left of\\r\\nhis great leader sat the poetic Snodgrass, and near him again the\\r\\nsporting Winkle; the former poetically enveloped in a mysterious blue\\r\\ncloak with a canine-skin collar, and the latter communicating additional\\r\\nlustre to a new green shooting-coat, plaid neckerchief, and closely-\\r\\nfitted drabs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pickwick’s oration upon this occasion, together with the debate\\r\\nthereon, is entered on the Transactions of the Club. Both bear a strong\\r\\naffinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies; and, as it is\\r\\nalways interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of\\r\\ngreat men, we transfer the entry to these pages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Mr. Pickwick observed (says the secretary) that fame was dear to the\\r\\nheart of every man. Poetic fame was dear to the heart of his friend\\r\\nSnodgrass; the fame of conquest was equally dear to his friend Tupman;\\r\\nand the desire of earning fame in the sports of the field, the air, and\\r\\nthe water was uppermost in the breast of his friend Winkle. He (Mr.\\r\\nPickwick) would not deny that he was influenced by human passions and\\r\\nhuman feelings (cheers)--possibly by human weaknesses (loud cries of\\r\\n“No”); but this he would say, that if ever the fire of self-importance\\r\\nbroke out in his bosom, the desire to benefit the human race in\\r\\npreference effectually quenched it. The praise of mankind was his swing;\\r\\nphilanthropy was his insurance office. (Vehement cheering.) He had felt\\r\\nsome pride--he acknowledged it freely, and let his enemies make the most\\r\\nof it--he had felt some pride when he presented his Tittlebatian Theory\\r\\nto the world; it might be celebrated or it might not. (A cry of “It is,”\\r\\n and great cheering.) He would take the assertion of that honourable\\r\\nPickwickian whose voice he had just heard--it was celebrated; but if the\\r\\nfame of that treatise were to extend to the farthest confines of the\\r\\nknown world, the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of\\r\\nthat production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which\\r\\nhe looked around him, on this, the proudest moment of his existence.\\r\\n(Cheers.) He was a humble individual. (“No, no.”) Still he could not but\\r\\nfeel that they had selected him for a service of great honour, and of\\r\\nsome danger. Travelling was in a troubled state, and the minds of\\r\\ncoachmen were unsettled. Let them look abroad and contemplate the scenes\\r\\nwhich were enacting around them. Stage-coaches were upsetting in all\\r\\ndirections, horses were bolting, boats were overturning, and boilers\\r\\nwere bursting. (Cheers--a voice “No.”) No! (Cheers.) Let that honourable\\r\\nPickwickian who cried “No” so loudly come forward and deny it, if he\\r\\ncould. (Cheers.) Who was it that cried “No”? (Enthusiastic cheering.)\\r\\nWas it some vain and disappointed man--he would not say haberdasher\\r\\n(loud cheers)--who, jealous of the praise which had been--perhaps\\r\\nundeservedly--bestowed on his (Mr. Pickwick’s) researches, and smarting\\r\\nunder the censure which had been heaped upon his own feeble attempts at\\r\\nrivalry, now took this vile and calumnious mode of--\\r\\n\\r\\n‘MR. BLOTTON (of Aldgate) rose to order. Did the honourable Pickwickian\\r\\nallude to him? (Cries of “Order,” “Chair,” “Yes,” “No,” “Go on,” “Leave\\r\\noff,” etc.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘MR. PICKWICK would not put up to be put down by clamour. He had alluded\\r\\nto the honourable gentleman. (Great excitement.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘MR. BLOTTON would only say then, that he repelled the hon. gent.’s\\r\\nfalse and scurrilous accusation, with profound contempt. (Great\\r\\ncheering.) The hon. gent. was a humbug. (Immense confusion, and loud\\r\\ncries of “Chair,” and “Order.”)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Mr. A. SNODGRASS rose to order. He threw himself upon the chair.\\r\\n(Hear.) He wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two\\r\\nmembers of that club should be allowed to continue. (Hear, hear.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The CHAIRMAN was quite sure the hon. Pickwickian would withdraw the\\r\\nexpression he had just made use of.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘MR. BLOTTON, with all possible respect for the chair, was quite sure he\\r\\nwould not.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The CHAIRMAN felt it his imperative duty to demand of the honourable\\r\\ngentleman, whether he had used the expression which had just escaped him\\r\\nin a common sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘MR. BLOTTON had no hesitation in saying that he had not--he had used\\r\\nthe word in its Pickwickian sense. (Hear, hear.) He was bound to\\r\\nacknowledge that, personally, he entertained the highest regard and\\r\\nesteem for the honourable gentleman; he had merely considered him a\\r\\nhumbug in a Pickwickian point of view. (Hear, hear.)\\r\\n\\r\\n‘MR. PICKWICK felt much gratified by the fair, candid, and full\\r\\nexplanation of his honourable friend. He begged it to be at once\\r\\nunderstood, that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a\\r\\nPickwickian construction. (Cheers.)’\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the entry terminates, as we have no doubt the debate did also,\\r\\nafter arriving at such a highly satisfactory and intelligible point. We\\r\\nhave no official statement of the facts which the reader will find\\r\\nrecorded in the next chapter, but they have been carefully collated from\\r\\nletters and other MS. authorities, so unquestionably genuine as to\\r\\njustify their narration in a connected form.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II. THE FIRST DAY’S JOURNEY, AND THE FIRST EVENING’S ADVENTURES;\\r\\nWITH THEIR CONSEQUENCES\\r\\n\\r\\nThat punctual servant of all work, the sun, had just risen, and begun to\\r\\nstrike a light on the morning of the thirteenth of May, one thousand\\r\\neight hundred and twenty-seven, when Mr. Samuel Pickwick burst like\\r\\nanother sun from his slumbers, threw open his chamber window, and looked\\r\\nout upon the world beneath. Goswell Street was at his feet, Goswell\\r\\nStreet was on his right hand--as far as the eye could reach, Goswell\\r\\nStreet extended on his left; and the opposite side of Goswell Street was\\r\\nover the way. ‘Such,’ thought Mr. Pickwick, ‘are the narrow views of\\r\\nthose philosophers who, content with examining the things that lie\\r\\nbefore them, look not to the truths which are hidden beyond. As well\\r\\nmight I be content to gaze on Goswell Street for ever, without one\\r\\neffort to penetrate to the hidden countries which on every side surround\\r\\nit.’ And having given vent to this beautiful reflection, Mr. Pickwick\\r\\nproceeded to put himself into his clothes, and his clothes into his\\r\\nportmanteau. Great men are seldom over scrupulous in the arrangement of\\r\\ntheir attire; the operation of shaving, dressing, and coffee-imbibing\\r\\nwas soon performed; and, in another hour, Mr. Pickwick, with his\\r\\nportmanteau in his hand, his telescope in his greatcoat pocket, and his\\r\\nnote-book in his waistcoat, ready for the reception of any discoveries\\r\\nworthy of being noted down, had arrived at the coach-stand in St.\\r\\nMartin’s-le-Grand.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Cab!’ said Mr. Pickwick.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Here you are, sir,’ shouted a strange specimen of the human race, in a\\r\\nsackcloth coat, and apron of the same, who, with a brass label and\\r\\nnumber round his neck, looked as if he were catalogued in some\\r\\ncollection of rarities. This was the waterman. ‘Here you are, sir. Now,\\r\\nthen, fust cab!’ And the first cab having been fetched from the public-\\r\\nhouse, where he had been smoking his first pipe, Mr. Pickwick and his\\r\\nportmanteau were thrown into the vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Golden Cross,’ said Mr. Pickwick.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Only a bob’s vorth, Tommy,’ cried the driver sulkily, for the\\r\\ninformation of his friend the waterman, as the cab drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘How old is that horse, my friend?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick, rubbing his\\r\\nnose with the shilling he had reserved for the fare.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Forty-two,’ replied the driver, eyeing him askant.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What!’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, laying his hand upon his note-book. The\\r\\ndriver reiterated his former statement. Mr. Pickwick looked very hard at\\r\\nthe man’s face, but his features were immovable, so he noted down the\\r\\nfact forthwith.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And how long do you keep him out at a time?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick,\\r\\nsearching for further information.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Two or three veeks,’ replied the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Weeks!’ said Mr. Pickwick in astonishment, and out came the note-book\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘He lives at Pentonwil when he’s at home,’ observed the driver coolly,\\r\\n‘but we seldom takes him home, on account of his weakness.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘On account of his weakness!’ reiterated the perplexed Mr. Pickwick.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘He always falls down when he’s took out o’ the cab,’ continued the\\r\\ndriver, ‘but when he’s in it, we bears him up werry tight, and takes him\\r\\nin werry short, so as he can’t werry well fall down; and we’ve got a\\r\\npair o’ precious large wheels on, so ven he does move, they run after\\r\\nhim, and he must go on--he can’t help it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Pickwick entered every word of this statement in his note-book, with\\r\\nthe view of communicating it to the club, as a singular instance of the\\r\\ntenacity of life in horses under trying circumstances. The entry was\\r\\nscarcely completed when they reached the Golden Cross. Down jumped the\\r\\ndriver, and out got Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Tupman, Mr. Snodgrass, and Mr.\\r\\nWinkle, who had been anxiously waiting the arrival of their illustrious\\r\\nleader, crowded to welcome him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Here’s your fare,’ said Mr. Pickwick, holding out the shilling to the\\r\\ndriver.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was the learned man’s astonishment, when that unaccountable person\\r\\nflung the money on the pavement, and requested in figurative terms to be\\r\\nallowed the pleasure of fighting him (Mr. Pickwick) for the amount!\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You are mad,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Or drunk,’ said Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Or both,’ said Mr. Tupman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Come on!’ said the cab-driver, sparring away like clockwork. ‘Come on--\\r\\nall four on you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Here’s a lark!’ shouted half a dozen hackney coachmen. ‘Go to vork,\\r\\nSam!--and they crowded with great glee round the party.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What’s the row, Sam?’ inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Row!’ replied the cabman, ‘what did he want my number for?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I didn’t want your number,’ said the astonished Mr. Pickwick.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What did you take it for, then?’ inquired the cabman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I didn’t take it,’ said Mr. Pickwick indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Would anybody believe,’ continued the cab-driver, appealing to the\\r\\ncrowd, ‘would anybody believe as an informer’ud go about in a man’s cab,\\r\\nnot only takin’ down his number, but ev’ry word he says into the\\r\\nbargain’ (a light flashed upon Mr. Pickwick--it was the note-book).\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Did he though?’ inquired another cabman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes, did he,’ replied the first; ‘and then arter aggerawatin’ me to\\r\\nassault him, gets three witnesses here to prove it. But I’ll give it\\r\\nhim, if I’ve six months for it. Come on!’ and the cabman dashed his hat\\r\\nupon the ground, with a reckless disregard of his own private property,\\r\\nand knocked Mr. Pickwick’s spectacles off, and followed up the attack\\r\\nwith a blow on Mr. Pickwick’s nose, and another on Mr. Pickwick’s chest,\\r\\nand a third in Mr. Snodgrass’s eye, and a fourth, by way of variety, in\\r\\nMr. Tupman’s waistcoat, and then danced into the road, and then back\\r\\nagain to the pavement, and finally dashed the whole temporary supply of\\r\\nbreath out of Mr. Winkle’s body; and all in half a dozen seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Where’s an officer?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Put ‘em under the pump,’ suggested a hot-pieman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You shall smart for this,’ gasped Mr. Pickwick.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Informers!’ shouted the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Come on,’ cried the cabman, who had been sparring without cessation the\\r\\nwhole time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mob hitherto had been passive spectators of the scene, but as the\\r\\nintelligence of the Pickwickians being informers was spread among them,\\r\\nthey began to canvass with considerable vivacity the propriety of\\r\\nenforcing the heated pastry-vendor’s proposition: and there is no saying\\r\\nwhat acts of personal aggression they might have committed, had not the\\r\\naffray been unexpectedly terminated by the interposition of a new-comer.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What’s the fun?’ said a rather tall, thin, young man, in a green coat,\\r\\nemerging suddenly from the coach-yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Informers!’ shouted the crowd again.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We are not,’ roared Mr. Pickwick, in a tone which, to any dispassionate\\r\\nlistener, carried conviction with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ain’t you, though--ain’t you?’ said the young man, appealing to Mr.\\r\\nPickwick, and making his way through the crowd by the infallible process\\r\\nof elbowing the countenances of its component members.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the\\r\\ncase.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Come along, then,’ said he of the green coat, lugging Mr. Pickwick\\r\\nafter him by main force, and talking the whole way. Here, No. 924, take\\r\\nyour fare, and take yourself off--respectable gentleman--know him well--\\r\\nnone of your nonsense--this way, sir--where’s your friends?--all a\\r\\nmistake, I see--never mind--accidents will happen--best regulated\\r\\nfamilies--never say die--down upon your luck--Pull him _up_--Put that in\\r\\nhis pipe--like the flavour--damned rascals.’ And with a lengthened\\r\\nstring of similar broken sentences, delivered with extraordinary\\r\\nvolubility, the stranger led the way to the traveller’s waiting-room,\\r\\nwhither he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and his disciples.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Here, waiter!’ shouted the stranger, ringing the bell with tremendous\\r\\nviolence, ‘glasses round--brandy-and-water, hot and strong, and sweet,\\r\\nand plenty,--eye damaged, Sir? Waiter! raw beef-steak for the\\r\\ngentleman’s eye--nothing like raw beef-steak for a bruise, sir; cold\\r\\nlamp-post very good, but lamp-post inconvenient--damned odd standing in\\r\\nthe open street half an hour, with your eye against a lamp-post--eh,--\\r\\nvery good--ha! ha!’ And the stranger, without stopping to take breath,\\r\\nswallowed at a draught full half a pint of the reeking brandy-and-water,\\r\\nand flung himself into a chair with as much ease as if nothing uncommon\\r\\nhad occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile his three companions were busily engaged in proffering their\\r\\nthanks to their new acquaintance, Mr. Pickwick had leisure to examine\\r\\nhis costume and appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was about the middle height, but the thinness of his body, and the\\r\\nlength of his legs, gave him the appearance of being much taller. The\\r\\ngreen coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow-tails,\\r\\nbut had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the\\r\\nstranger, for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his\\r\\nwrists. It was buttoned closely up to his chin, at the imminent hazard\\r\\nof splitting the back; and an old stock, without a vestige of shirt\\r\\ncollar, ornamented his neck. His scanty black trousers displayed here\\r\\nand there those shiny patches which bespeak long service, and were\\r\\nstrapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes, as if to\\r\\nconceal the dirty white stockings, which were nevertheless distinctly\\r\\nvisible. His long, black hair escaped in negligent waves from beneath\\r\\neach side of his old pinched-up hat; and glimpses of his bare wrists\\r\\nmight be observed between the tops of his gloves and the cuffs of his\\r\\ncoat sleeves. His face was thin and haggard; but an indescribable air of\\r\\njaunty impudence and perfect self-possession pervaded the whole man.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the individual on whom Mr. Pickwick gazed through his\\r\\nspectacles (which he had fortunately recovered), and to whom he\\r\\nproceeded, when his friends had exhausted themselves, to return in\\r\\nchosen terms his warmest thanks for his recent assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Never mind,’ said the stranger, cutting the address very short, ‘said\\r\\nenough--no more; smart chap that cabman--handled his fives well; but if\\r\\nI’d been your friend in the green jemmy--damn me--punch his head,--‘cod\\r\\nI would,--pig’s whisper--pieman too,--no gammon.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThis coherent speech was interrupted by the entrance of the Rochester\\r\\ncoachman, to announce that ‘the Commodore’ was on the point of starting.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Commodore!’ said the stranger, starting up, ‘my coach--place booked,--\\r\\none outside--leave you to pay for the brandy-and-water,--want change for\\r\\na five,--bad silver--Brummagem buttons--won’t do--no go--eh?’ and he\\r\\nshook his head most knowingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it so happened that Mr. Pickwick and his three companions had\\r\\nresolved to make Rochester their first halting-place too; and having\\r\\nintimated to their new-found acquaintance that they were journeying to\\r\\nthe same city, they agreed to occupy the seat at the back of the coach,\\r\\nwhere they could all sit together.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Up with you,’ said the stranger, assisting Mr. Pickwick on to the roof\\r\\nwith so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman’s\\r\\ndeportment very materially.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Any luggage, Sir?’ inquired the coachman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Who--I? Brown paper parcel here, that’s all--other luggage gone by\\r\\nwater--packing-cases, nailed up--big as houses--heavy, heavy, damned\\r\\nheavy,’ replied the stranger, as he forced into his pocket as much as he\\r\\ncould of the brown paper parcel, which presented most suspicious\\r\\nindications of containing one shirt and a handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Heads, heads--take care of your heads!’ cried the loquacious stranger,\\r\\nas they came out under the low archway, which in those days formed the\\r\\nentrance to the coach-yard. ‘Terrible place--dangerous work--other day--\\r\\nfive children--mother--tall lady, eating sandwiches--forgot the arch--\\r\\ncrash--knock--children look round--mother’s head off--sandwich in her\\r\\nhand--no mouth to put it in--head of a family off--shocking, shocking!\\r\\nLooking at Whitehall, sir?--fine place--little window--somebody else’s\\r\\nhead off there, eh, sir?--he didn’t keep a sharp look-out enough either-\\r\\n-eh, Sir, eh?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I am ruminating,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘on the strange mutability of\\r\\nhuman affairs.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah! I see--in at the palace door one day, out at the window the next.\\r\\nPhilosopher, Sir?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘An observer of human nature, Sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah, so am I. Most people are when they’ve little to do and less to get.\\r\\nPoet, Sir?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My friend Mr. Snodgrass has a strong poetic turn,’ said Mr. Pickwick.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘So have I,’ said the stranger. ‘Epic poem--ten thousand lines--\\r\\nrevolution of July--composed it on the spot--Mars by day, Apollo by\\r\\nnight--bang the field-piece, twang the lyre.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You were present at that glorious scene, sir?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Present! think I was;* fired a musket--fired with an idea--rushed into\\r\\nwine shop--wrote it down--back again--whiz, bang--another idea--wine\\r\\nshop again--pen and ink--back again--cut and slash--noble time, Sir.\\r\\nSportsman, sir?’ abruptly turning to Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n* A remarkable instance of the prophetic force of Mr. Jingle’s\\r\\nimagination; this dialogue occurring in the year 1827, and the\\r\\nRevolution in 1830.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A little, Sir,’ replied that gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Fine pursuit, sir--fine pursuit.--Dogs, Sir?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not just now,’ said Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah! you should keep dogs--fine animals--sagacious creatures--dog of my\\r\\nown once--pointer--surprising instinct--out shooting one day--entering\\r\\ninclosure--whistled--dog stopped--whistled again--Ponto--no go; stock\\r\\nstill--called him--Ponto, Ponto--wouldn’t move--dog transfixed--staring\\r\\nat a board--looked up, saw an inscription--“Gamekeeper has orders to\\r\\nshoot all dogs found in this inclosure”--wouldn’t pass it--wonderful\\r\\ndog--valuable dog that--very.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Singular circumstance that,’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘Will you allow me to\\r\\nmake a note of it?’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Certainly, Sir, certainly--hundred more anecdotes of the same animal.--\\r\\nFine girl, Sir’ (to Mr. Tracy Tupman, who had been bestowing sundry\\r\\nanti-Pickwickian glances on a young lady by the roadside).\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very!’ said Mr. Tupman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘English girls not so fine as Spanish--noble creatures--jet hair--black\\r\\neyes--lovely forms--sweet creatures--beautiful.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You have been in Spain, sir?’ said Mr. Tracy Tupman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Lived there--ages.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Many conquests, sir?’ inquired Mr. Tupman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Conquests! Thousands. Don Bolaro Fizzgig--grandee--only daughter--Donna\\r\\nChristina--splendid creature--loved me to distraction--jealous father--\\r\\nhigh-souled daughter--handsome Englishman--Donna Christina in despair--\\r\\nprussic acid--stomach pump in my portmanteau--operation performed--old\\r\\nBolaro in ecstasies--consent to our union--join hands and floods of\\r\\ntears--romantic story--very.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Is the lady in England now, sir?’ inquired Mr. Tupman, on whom the\\r\\ndescription of her charms had produced a powerful impression.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Dead, sir--dead,’ said the stranger, applying to his right eye the\\r\\nbrief remnant of a very old cambric handkerchief. ‘Never recovered the\\r\\nstomach pump--undermined constitution--fell a victim.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And her father?’ inquired the poetic Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Remorse and misery,’ replied the stranger. ‘Sudden disappearance--talk\\r\\nof the whole city--search made everywhere without success--public\\r\\nfountain in the great square suddenly ceased playing--weeks elapsed--\\r\\nstill a stoppage--workmen employed to clean it--water drawn off--father-\\r\\nin-law discovered sticking head first in the main pipe, with a full\\r\\nconfession in his right boot--took him out, and the fountain played away\\r\\nagain, as well as ever.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Will you allow me to note that little romance down, Sir?’ said Mr.\\r\\nSnodgrass, deeply affected.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Certainly, Sir, certainly--fifty more if you like to hear ‘em--strange\\r\\nlife mine--rather curious history--not extraordinary, but singular.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this strain, with an occasional glass of ale, by way of parenthesis,\\r\\nwhen the coach changed horses, did the stranger proceed, until they\\r\\nreached Rochester bridge, by which time the note-books, both of Mr.\\r\\nPickwick and Mr. Snodgrass, were completely filled with selections from\\r\\nhis adventures.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Magnificent ruin!’ said Mr. Augustus Snodgrass, with all the poetic\\r\\nfervour that distinguished him, when they came in sight of the fine old\\r\\ncastle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What a study for an antiquarian!’ were the very words which fell from\\r\\nMr. Pickwick’s mouth, as he applied his telescope to his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah! fine place,’ said the stranger, ‘glorious pile--frowning walls--\\r\\ntottering arches--dark nooks--crumbling staircases--old cathedral too--\\r\\nearthy smell--pilgrims’ feet wore away the old steps--little Saxon\\r\\ndoors--confessionals like money-takers’ boxes at theatres--queer\\r\\ncustomers those monks--popes, and lord treasurers, and all sorts of old\\r\\nfellows, with great red faces, and broken noses, turning up every day--\\r\\nbuff jerkins too--match-locks--sarcophagus--fine place--old legends too-\\r\\n-strange stories: capital;’ and the stranger continued to soliloquise\\r\\nuntil they reached the Bull Inn, in the High Street, where the coach\\r\\nstopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Do you remain here, Sir?’ inquired Mr. Nathaniel Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Here--not I--but you’d better--good house--nice beds--Wright’s next\\r\\nhouse, dear--very dear--half-a-crown in the bill if you look at the\\r\\nwaiter--charge you more if you dine at a friend’s than they would if you\\r\\ndined in the coffee-room--rum fellows--very.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Winkle turned to Mr. Pickwick, and murmured a few words; a whisper\\r\\npassed from Mr. Pickwick to Mr. Snodgrass, from Mr. Snodgrass to Mr.\\r\\nTupman, and nods of assent were exchanged. Mr. Pickwick addressed the\\r\\nstranger.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You rendered us a very important service this morning, sir,’ said he,\\r\\n‘will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging\\r\\nthe favour of your company at dinner?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Great pleasure--not presume to dictate, but broiled fowl and mushrooms-\\r\\n-capital thing! What time?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Let me see,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, referring to his watch, ‘it is now\\r\\nnearly three. Shall we say five?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Suit me excellently,’ said the stranger, ‘five precisely--till then--\\r\\ncare of yourselves;’ and lifting the pinched-up hat a few inches from\\r\\nhis head, and carelessly replacing it very much on one side, the\\r\\nstranger, with half the brown paper parcel sticking out of his pocket,\\r\\nwalked briskly up the yard, and turned into the High Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Evidently a traveller in many countries, and a close observer of men\\r\\nand things,’ said Mr. Pickwick.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I should like to see his poem,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I should like to have seen that dog,’ said Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tupman said nothing; but he thought of Donna Christina, the stomach\\r\\npump, and the fountain; and his eyes filled with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nA private sitting-room having been engaged, bedrooms inspected, and\\r\\ndinner ordered, the party walked out to view the city and adjoining\\r\\nneighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not find, from a careful perusal of Mr. Pickwick’s notes of the\\r\\nfour towns, Stroud, Rochester, Chatham, and Brompton, that his\\r\\nimpressions of their appearance differ in any material point from those\\r\\nof other travellers who have gone over the same ground. His general\\r\\ndescription is easily abridged.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The principal productions of these towns,’ says Mr. Pickwick, ‘appear\\r\\nto be soldiers, sailors, Jews, chalk, shrimps, officers, and dockyard\\r\\nmen. The commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are\\r\\nmarine stores, hard-bake, apples, flat-fish, and oysters. The streets\\r\\npresent a lively and animated appearance, occasioned chiefly by the\\r\\nconviviality of the military. It is truly delightful to a philanthropic\\r\\nmind to see these gallant men staggering along under the influence of an\\r\\noverflow both of animal and ardent spirits; more especially when we\\r\\nremember that the following them about, and jesting with them, affords a\\r\\ncheap and innocent amusement for the boy population. Nothing,’ adds Mr.\\r\\nPickwick, ‘can exceed their good-humour. It was but the day before my\\r\\narrival that one of them had been most grossly insulted in the house of\\r\\na publican. The barmaid had positively refused to draw him any more\\r\\nliquor; in return for which he had (merely in playfulness) drawn his\\r\\nbayonet, and wounded the girl in the shoulder. And yet this fine fellow\\r\\nwas the very first to go down to the house next morning and express his\\r\\nreadiness to overlook the matter, and forget what had occurred!\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The consumption of tobacco in these towns,’ continues Mr. Pickwick,\\r\\n‘must be very great, and the smell which pervades the streets must be\\r\\nexceedingly delicious to those who are extremely fond of smoking. A\\r\\nsuperficial traveller might object to the dirt, which is their leading\\r\\ncharacteristic; but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and\\r\\ncommercial prosperity, it is truly gratifying.’\\r\\n\\r\\nPunctual to five o’clock came the stranger, and shortly afterwards the\\r\\ndinner. He had divested himself of his brown paper parcel, but had made\\r\\nno alteration in his attire, and was, if possible, more loquacious than\\r\\never.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What’s that?’ he inquired, as the waiter removed one of the covers.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Soles, Sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Soles--ah!--capital fish--all come from London-stage-coach proprietors\\r\\nget up political dinners--carriage of soles--dozens of baskets--cunning\\r\\nfellows. Glass of wine, Sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘With pleasure,’ said Mr. Pickwick; and the stranger took wine, first\\r\\nwith him, and then with Mr. Snodgrass, and then with Mr. Tupman, and\\r\\nthen with Mr. Winkle, and then with the whole party together, almost as\\r\\nrapidly as he talked.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Devil of a mess on the staircase, waiter,’ said the stranger. ‘Forms\\r\\ngoing up--carpenters coming down--lamps, glasses, harps. What’s going\\r\\nforward?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ball, Sir,’ said the waiter.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Assembly, eh?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No, Sir, not assembly, Sir. Ball for the benefit of a charity, Sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Many fine women in this town, do you know, Sir?’ inquired Mr. Tupman,\\r\\nwith great interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Splendid--capital. Kent, sir--everybody knows Kent--apples, cherries,\\r\\nhops, and women. Glass of wine, Sir!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘With great pleasure,’ replied Mr. Tupman. The stranger filled, and\\r\\nemptied.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I should very much like to go,’ said Mr. Tupman, resuming the subject\\r\\nof the ball, ‘very much.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Tickets at the bar, Sir,’ interposed the waiter; ‘half-a-guinea each,\\r\\nSir.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tupman again expressed an earnest wish to be present at the\\r\\nfestivity; but meeting with no response in the darkened eye of Mr.\\r\\nSnodgrass, or the abstracted gaze of Mr. Pickwick, he applied himself\\r\\nwith great interest to the port wine and dessert, which had just been\\r\\nplaced on the table. The waiter withdrew, and the party were left to\\r\\nenjoy the cosy couple of hours succeeding dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Beg your pardon, sir,’ said the stranger, ‘bottle stands--pass it\\r\\nround--way of the sun--through the button-hole--no heeltaps,’ and he\\r\\nemptied his glass, which he had filled about two minutes before, and\\r\\npoured out another, with the air of a man who was used to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wine was passed, and a fresh supply ordered. The visitor talked, the\\r\\nPickwickians listened. Mr. Tupman felt every moment more disposed for\\r\\nthe ball. Mr. Pickwick’s countenance glowed with an expression of\\r\\nuniversal philanthropy, and Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass fell fast\\r\\nasleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘They’re beginning upstairs,’ said the stranger--‘hear the company--\\r\\nfiddles tuning--now the harp--there they go.’ The various sounds which\\r\\nfound their way downstairs announced the commencement of the first\\r\\nquadrille.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘How I should like to go,’ said Mr. Tupman again.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘So should I,’ said the stranger--‘confounded luggage,--heavy smacks--\\r\\nnothing to go in--odd, ain’t it?’\\r\\n\\r\\nNow general benevolence was one of the leading features of the\\r\\nPickwickian theory, and no one was more remarkable for the zealous\\r\\nmanner in which he observed so noble a principle than Mr. Tracy Tupman.\\r\\nThe number of instances recorded on the Transactions of the Society, in\\r\\nwhich that excellent man referred objects of charity to the houses of\\r\\nother members for left-off garments or pecuniary relief is almost\\r\\nincredible.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the\\r\\npurpose,’ said Mr. Tracy Tupman, ‘but you are rather slim, and I am--’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Rather fat--grown-up Bacchus--cut the leaves--dismounted from the tub,\\r\\nand adopted kersey, eh?--not double distilled, but double milled--ha!\\r\\nha! pass the wine.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether Mr. Tupman was somewhat indignant at the peremptory tone in\\r\\nwhich he was desired to pass the wine which the stranger passed so\\r\\nquickly away, or whether he felt very properly scandalised at an\\r\\ninfluential member of the Pickwick Club being ignominiously compared to\\r\\na dismounted Bacchus, is a fact not yet completely ascertained. He\\r\\npassed the wine, coughed twice, and looked at the stranger for several\\r\\nseconds with a stern intensity; as that individual, however, appeared\\r\\nperfectly collected, and quite calm under his searching glance, he\\r\\ngradually relaxed, and reverted to the subject of the ball.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I was about to observe, Sir,’ he said, ‘that though my apparel would be\\r\\ntoo large, a suit of my friend Mr. Winkle’s would, perhaps, fit you\\r\\nbetter.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger took Mr. Winkle’s measure with his eye, and that feature\\r\\nglistened with satisfaction as he said, ‘Just the thing.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tupman looked round him. The wine, which had exerted its somniferous\\r\\ninfluence over Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle, had stolen upon the senses\\r\\nof Mr. Pickwick. That gentleman had gradually passed through the various\\r\\nstages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner, and its\\r\\nconsequences. He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height\\r\\nof conviviality to the depth of misery, and from the depth of misery to\\r\\nthe height of conviviality. Like a gas-lamp in the street, with the wind\\r\\nin the pipe, he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy, then\\r\\nsank so low as to be scarcely discernible; after a short interval, he\\r\\nhad burst out again, to enlighten for a moment; then flickered with an\\r\\nuncertain, staggering sort of light, and then gone out altogether. His\\r\\nhead was sunk upon his bosom, and perpetual snoring, with a partial\\r\\nchoke occasionally, were the only audible indications of the great man’s\\r\\npresence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temptation to be present at the ball, and to form his first\\r\\nimpressions of the beauty of the Kentish ladies, was strong upon Mr.\\r\\nTupman. The temptation to take the stranger with him was equally great.\\r\\nHe was wholly unacquainted with the place and its inhabitants, and the\\r\\nstranger seemed to possess as great a knowledge of both as if he had\\r\\nlived there from his infancy. Mr. Winkle was asleep, and Mr. Tupman had\\r\\nhad sufficient experience in such matters to know that the moment he\\r\\nawoke he would, in the ordinary course of nature, roll heavily to bed.\\r\\nHe was undecided. ‘Fill your glass, and pass the wine,’ said the\\r\\nindefatigable visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tupman did as he was requested; and the additional stimulus of the\\r\\nlast glass settled his determination.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Winkle’s bedroom is inside mine,’ said Mr. Tupman; ‘I couldn’t make him\\r\\nunderstand what I wanted, if I woke him now, but I know he has a dress-\\r\\nsuit in a carpet bag; and supposing you wore it to the ball, and took it\\r\\noff when we returned, I could replace it without troubling him at all\\r\\nabout the matter.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Capital,’ said the stranger, ‘famous plan--damned odd situation--\\r\\nfourteen coats in the packing-cases, and obliged to wear another man’s--\\r\\nvery good notion, that--very.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We must purchase our tickets,’ said Mr. Tupman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not worth while splitting a guinea,’ said the stranger, ‘toss who shall\\r\\npay for both--I call; you spin--first time--woman--woman--bewitching\\r\\nwoman,’ and down came the sovereign with the dragon (called by courtesy\\r\\na woman) uppermost.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tupman rang the bell, purchased the tickets, and ordered chamber\\r\\ncandlesticks. In another quarter of an hour the stranger was completely\\r\\narrayed in a full suit of Mr. Nathaniel Winkle’s.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It’s a new coat,’ said Mr. Tupman, as the stranger surveyed himself\\r\\nwith great complacency in a cheval glass; ‘the first that’s been made\\r\\nwith our club button,’ and he called his companions’ attention to the\\r\\nlarge gilt button which displayed a bust of Mr. Pickwick in the centre,\\r\\nand the letters ‘P. C.’ on either side.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘“P. C.”’ said the stranger--‘queer set out--old fellow’s likeness, and\\r\\n“P. C.”--What does “P. C.” stand for--Peculiar Coat, eh?’ Mr. Tupman,\\r\\nwith rising indignation and great importance, explained the mystic\\r\\ndevice.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Rather short in the waist, ain’t it?’ said the stranger, screwing\\r\\nhimself round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons,\\r\\nwhich were half-way up his back. ‘Like a general postman’s coat--queer\\r\\ncoats those--made by contract--no measuring--mysterious dispensations of\\r\\nProvidence--all the short men get long coats--all the long men short\\r\\nones.’ Running on in this way, Mr. Tupman’s new companion adjusted his\\r\\ndress, or rather the dress of Mr. Winkle; and, accompanied by Mr.\\r\\nTupman, ascended the staircase leading to the ballroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What names, sir?’ said the man at the door. Mr. Tracy Tupman was\\r\\nstepping forward to announce his own titles, when the stranger prevented\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No names at all;’ and then he whispered Mr. Tupman, ‘names won’t do--\\r\\nnot known--very good names in their way, but not great ones--capital\\r\\nnames for a small party, but won’t make an impression in public\\r\\nassemblies--incog. the thing--gentlemen from London--distinguished\\r\\nforeigners--anything.’ The door was thrown open, and Mr. Tracy Tupman\\r\\nand the stranger entered the ballroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a long room, with crimson-covered benches, and wax candles in\\r\\nglass chandeliers. The musicians were securely confined in an elevated\\r\\nden, and quadrilles were being systematically got through by two or\\r\\nthree sets of dancers. Two card-tables were made up in the adjoining\\r\\ncard-room, and two pair of old ladies, and a corresponding number of\\r\\nstout gentlemen, were executing whist therein.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe finale concluded, the dancers promenaded the room, and Mr. Tupman\\r\\nand his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the\\r\\ncompany.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Charming women,’ said Mr. Tupman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Wait a minute,’ said the stranger, ‘fun presently--nobs not come yet--\\r\\nqueer place--dockyard people of upper rank don’t know dockyard people of\\r\\nlower rank--dockyard people of lower rank don’t know small gentry--small\\r\\ngentry don’t know tradespeople--commissioner don’t know anybody.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Who’s that little boy with the light hair and pink eyes, in a fancy\\r\\ndress?’ inquired Mr. Tupman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Hush, pray--pink eyes--fancy dress--little boy--nonsense--ensign 97th--\\r\\nHonourable Wilmot Snipe--great family--Snipes--very.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Sir Thomas Clubber, Lady Clubber, and the Misses Clubber!’ shouted the\\r\\nman at the door in a stentorian voice. A great sensation was created\\r\\nthroughout the room by the entrance of a tall gentleman in a blue coat\\r\\nand bright buttons, a large lady in blue satin, and two young ladies, on\\r\\na similar scale, in fashionably-made dresses of the same hue.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Commissioner--head of the yard--great man--remarkably great man,’\\r\\nwhispered the stranger in Mr. Tupman’s ear, as the charitable committee\\r\\nushered Sir Thomas Clubber and family to the top of the room. The\\r\\nHonourable Wilmot Snipe, and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to\\r\\nrender homage to the Misses Clubber; and Sir Thomas Clubber stood bolt\\r\\nupright, and looked majestically over his black kerchief at the\\r\\nassembled company.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Mr. Smithie, Mrs. Smithie, and the Misses Smithie,’ was the next\\r\\nannouncement.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What’s Mr. Smithie?’ inquired Mr. Tracy Tupman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Something in the yard,’ replied the stranger. Mr. Smithie bowed\\r\\ndeferentially to Sir Thomas Clubber; and Sir Thomas Clubber acknowledged\\r\\nthe salute with conscious condescension. Lady Clubber took a telescopic\\r\\nview of Mrs. Smithie and family through her eye-glass and Mrs. Smithie\\r\\nstared in her turn at Mrs. Somebody-else, whose husband was not in the\\r\\ndockyard at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Colonel Bulder, Mrs. Colonel Bulder, and Miss Bulder,’ were the next\\r\\narrivals.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Head of the garrison,’ said the stranger, in reply to Mr. Tupman’s\\r\\ninquiring look.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bulder was warmly welcomed by the Misses Clubber; the greeting\\r\\nbetween Mrs. Colonel Bulder and Lady Clubber was of the most\\r\\naffectionate description; Colonel Bulder and Sir Thomas Clubber\\r\\nexchanged snuff-boxes, and looked very much like a pair of Alexander\\r\\nSelkirks--‘Monarchs of all they surveyed.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the aristocracy of the place--the Bulders, and Clubbers, and\\r\\nSnipes--were thus preserving their dignity at the upper end of the room,\\r\\nthe other classes of society were imitating their example in other parts\\r\\nof it. The less aristocratic officers of the 97th devoted themselves to\\r\\nthe families of the less important functionaries from the dockyard. The\\r\\nsolicitors’ wives, and the wine-merchant’s wife, headed another grade\\r\\n(the brewer’s wife visited the Bulders); and Mrs. Tomlinson, the post-\\r\\noffice keeper, seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader\\r\\nof the trade party.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most popular personages, in his own circle, present, was a\\r\\nlittle fat man, with a ring of upright black hair round his head, and an\\r\\nextensive bald plain on the top of it--Doctor Slammer, surgeon to the\\r\\n97th. The doctor took snuff with everybody, chatted with everybody,\\r\\nlaughed, danced, made jokes, played whist, did everything, and was\\r\\neverywhere. To these pursuits, multifarious as they were, the little\\r\\ndoctor added a more important one than any--he was indefatigable in\\r\\npaying the most unremitting and devoted attention to a little old widow,\\r\\nwhose rich dress and profusion of ornament bespoke her a most desirable\\r\\naddition to a limited income.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the doctor, and the widow, the eyes of both Mr. Tupman and his\\r\\ncompanion had been fixed for some time, when the stranger broke silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Lots of money--old girl--pompous doctor--not a bad idea--good fun,’\\r\\nwere the intelligible sentences which issued from his lips. Mr. Tupman\\r\\nlooked inquisitively in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I’ll dance with the widow,’ said the stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Who is she?’ inquired Mr. Tupman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Don’t know--never saw her in all my life--cut out the doctor--here\\r\\ngoes.’ And the stranger forthwith crossed the room; and, leaning against\\r\\na mantel-piece, commenced gazing with an air of respectful and\\r\\nmelancholy admiration on the fat countenance of the little old lady. Mr.\\r\\nTupman looked on, in mute astonishment. The stranger progressed rapidly;\\r\\nthe little doctor danced with another lady; the widow dropped her fan;\\r\\nthe stranger picked it up, and presented it--a smile--a bow--a curtsey--\\r\\na few words of conversation. The stranger walked boldly up to, and\\r\\nreturned with, the master of the ceremonies; a little introductory\\r\\npantomime; and the stranger and Mrs. Budger took their places in a\\r\\nquadrille.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe surprise of Mr. Tupman at this summary proceeding, great as it was,\\r\\nwas immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor. The\\r\\nstranger was young, and the widow was flattered. The doctor’s attentions\\r\\nwere unheeded by the widow; and the doctor’s indignation was wholly lost\\r\\non his imperturbable rival. Doctor Slammer was paralysed. He, Doctor\\r\\nSlammer, of the 97th, to be extinguished in a moment, by a man whom\\r\\nnobody had ever seen before, and whom nobody knew even now! Doctor\\r\\nSlammer--Doctor Slammer of the 97th rejected! Impossible! It could not\\r\\nbe! Yes, it was; there they were. What! introducing his friend! Could he\\r\\nbelieve his eyes! He looked again, and was under the painful necessity\\r\\nof admitting the veracity of his optics; Mrs. Budger was dancing with\\r\\nMr. Tracy Tupman; there was no mistaking the fact. There was the widow\\r\\nbefore him, bouncing bodily here and there, with unwonted vigour; and\\r\\nMr. Tracy Tupman hopping about, with a face expressive of the most\\r\\nintense solemnity, dancing (as a good many people do) as if a quadrille\\r\\nwere not a thing to be laughed at, but a severe trial to the feelings,\\r\\nwhich it requires inflexible resolution to encounter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSilently and patiently did the doctor bear all this, and all the\\r\\nhandings of negus, and watching for glasses, and darting for biscuits,\\r\\nand coquetting, that ensued; but, a few seconds after the stranger had\\r\\ndisappeared to lead Mrs. Budger to her carriage, he darted swiftly from\\r\\nthe room with every particle of his hitherto-bottled-up indignation\\r\\neffervescing, from all parts of his countenance, in a perspiration of\\r\\npassion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stranger was returning, and Mr. Tupman was beside him. He spoke in a\\r\\nlow tone, and laughed. The little doctor thirsted for his life. He was\\r\\nexulting. He had triumphed.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Sir!’ said the doctor, in an awful voice, producing a card, and\\r\\nretiring into an angle of the passage, ‘my name is Slammer, Doctor\\r\\nSlammer, sir--97th Regiment--Chatham Barracks--my card, Sir, my card.’\\r\\nHe would have added more, but his indignation choked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah!’ replied the stranger coolly, ‘Slammer--much obliged--polite\\r\\nattention--not ill now, Slammer--but when I am--knock you up.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You--you’re a shuffler, sir,’ gasped the furious doctor, ‘a poltroon--a\\r\\ncoward--a liar--a--a--will nothing induce you to give me your card,\\r\\nsir!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh! I see,’ said the stranger, half aside, ‘negus too strong here--\\r\\nliberal landlord--very foolish--very--lemonade much better--hot rooms--\\r\\nelderly gentlemen--suffer for it in the morning--cruel--cruel;’ and he\\r\\nmoved on a step or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You are stopping in this house, Sir,’ said the indignant little man;\\r\\n‘you are intoxicated now, Sir; you shall hear from me in the morning,\\r\\nsir. I shall find you out, sir; I shall find you out.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Rather you found me out than found me at home,’ replied the unmoved\\r\\nstranger.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctor Slammer looked unutterable ferocity, as he fixed his hat on his\\r\\nhead with an indignant knock; and the stranger and Mr. Tupman ascended\\r\\nto the bedroom of the latter to restore the borrowed plumage to the\\r\\nunconscious Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat gentleman was fast asleep; the restoration was soon made. The\\r\\nstranger was extremely jocose; and Mr. Tracy Tupman, being quite\\r\\nbewildered with wine, negus, lights, and ladies, thought the whole\\r\\naffair was an exquisite joke. His new friend departed; and, after\\r\\nexperiencing some slight difficulty in finding the orifice in his\\r\\nnightcap, originally intended for the reception of his head, and finally\\r\\noverturning his candlestick in his struggles to put it on, Mr. Tracy\\r\\nTupman managed to get into bed by a series of complicated evolutions,\\r\\nand shortly afterwards sank into repose.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven o’clock had hardly ceased striking on the following morning, when\\r\\nMr. Pickwick’s comprehensive mind was aroused from the state of\\r\\nunconsciousness, in which slumber had plunged it, by a loud knocking at\\r\\nhis chamber door.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Who’s there?’ said Mr. Pickwick, starting up in bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Boots, sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What do you want?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Please, sir, can you tell me which gentleman of your party wears a\\r\\nbright blue dress-coat, with a gilt button with “P. C.” on it?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It’s been given out to brush,’ thought Mr. Pickwick, ‘and the man has\\r\\nforgotten whom it belongs to.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Winkle,’ he called out, ‘next room but two, on the right hand.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Thank’ee, sir,’ said the Boots, and away he went.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What’s the matter?’ cried Mr. Tupman, as a loud knocking at his door\\r\\nroused him from his oblivious repose.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Can I speak to Mr. Winkle, sir?’ replied Boots from the outside.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Winkle--Winkle!’ shouted Mr. Tupman, calling into the inner room.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Hollo!’ replied a faint voice from within the bed-clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You’re wanted--some one at the door;’ and, having exerted himself to\\r\\narticulate thus much, Mr. Tracy Tupman turned round and fell fast asleep\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Wanted!’ said Mr. Winkle, hastily jumping out of bed, and putting on a\\r\\nfew articles of clothing; ‘wanted! at this distance from town--who on\\r\\nearth can want me?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Gentleman in the coffee-room, sir,’ replied the Boots, as Mr. Winkle\\r\\nopened the door and confronted him; ‘gentleman says he’ll not detain you\\r\\na moment, Sir, but he can take no denial.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very odd!’ said Mr. Winkle; ‘I’ll be down directly.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hurriedly wrapped himself in a travelling-shawl and dressing-gown,\\r\\nand proceeded downstairs. An old woman and a couple of waiters were\\r\\ncleaning the coffee-room, and an officer in undress uniform was looking\\r\\nout of the window. He turned round as Mr. Winkle entered, and made a\\r\\nstiff inclination of the head. Having ordered the attendants to retire,\\r\\nand closed the door very carefully, he said, ‘Mr. Winkle, I presume?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My name is Winkle, sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You will not be surprised, sir, when I inform you that I have called\\r\\nhere this morning on behalf of my friend, Doctor Slammer, of the 97th.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Doctor Slammer!’ said Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Doctor Slammer. He begged me to express his opinion that your conduct\\r\\nof last evening was of a description which no gentleman could endure;\\r\\nand’ (he added) ‘which no one gentleman would pursue towards another.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Winkle’s astonishment was too real, and too evident, to escape the\\r\\nobservation of Doctor Slammer’s friend; he therefore proceeded--\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My friend, Doctor Slammer, requested me to add, that he was firmly\\r\\npersuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening, and\\r\\npossibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of. He\\r\\ncommissioned me to say, that should this be pleaded as an excuse for\\r\\nyour behaviour, he will consent to accept a written apology, to be\\r\\npenned by you, from my dictation.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A written apology!’ repeated Mr. Winkle, in the most emphatic tone of\\r\\namazement possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Of course you know the alternative,’ replied the visitor coolly.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Were you intrusted with this message to me by name?’ inquired Mr.\\r\\nWinkle, whose intellects were hopelessly confused by this extraordinary\\r\\nconversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I was not present myself,’ replied the visitor, ‘and in consequence of\\r\\nyour firm refusal to give your card to Doctor Slammer, I was desired by\\r\\nthat gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat--a bright\\r\\nblue dress-coat, with a gilt button displaying a bust, and the letters\\r\\n“P. C.”’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Winkle actually staggered with astonishment as he heard his own\\r\\ncostume thus minutely described. Doctor Slammer’s friend proceeded:--\\r\\n‘From the inquiries I made at the bar, just now, I was convinced that\\r\\nthe owner of the coat in question arrived here, with three gentlemen,\\r\\nyesterday afternoon. I immediately sent up to the gentleman who was\\r\\ndescribed as appearing the head of the party, and he at once referred me\\r\\nto you.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the principal tower of Rochester Castle had suddenly walked from its\\r\\nfoundation, and stationed itself opposite the coffee-room window, Mr.\\r\\nWinkle’s surprise would have been as nothing compared with the profound\\r\\nastonishment with which he had heard this address. His first impression\\r\\nwas that his coat had been stolen. ‘Will you allow me to detain you one\\r\\nmoment?’ said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Certainly,’ replied the unwelcome visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Winkle ran hastily upstairs, and with a trembling hand opened the\\r\\nbag. There was the coat in its usual place, but exhibiting, on a close\\r\\ninspection, evident tokens of having been worn on the preceding night.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It must be so,’ said Mr. Winkle, letting the coat fall from his hands.\\r\\n‘I took too much wine after dinner, and have a very vague recollection\\r\\nof walking about the streets, and smoking a cigar afterwards. The fact\\r\\nis, I was very drunk;--I must have changed my coat--gone somewhere--and\\r\\ninsulted somebody--I have no doubt of it; and this message is the\\r\\nterrible consequence.’ Saying which, Mr. Winkle retraced his steps in\\r\\nthe direction of the coffee-room, with the gloomy and dreadful resolve\\r\\nof accepting the challenge of the warlike Doctor Slammer, and abiding by\\r\\nthe worst consequences that might ensue.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this determination Mr. Winkle was urged by a variety of\\r\\nconsiderations, the first of which was his reputation with the club. He\\r\\nhad always been looked up to as a high authority on all matters of\\r\\namusement and dexterity, whether offensive, defensive, or inoffensive;\\r\\nand if, on this very first occasion of being put to the test, he shrunk\\r\\nback from the trial, beneath his leader’s eye, his name and standing\\r\\nwere lost for ever. Besides, he remembered to have heard it frequently\\r\\nsurmised by the uninitiated in such matters that by an understood\\r\\narrangement between the seconds, the pistols were seldom loaded with\\r\\nball; and, furthermore, he reflected that if he applied to Mr. Snodgrass\\r\\nto act as his second, and depicted the danger in glowing terms, that\\r\\ngentleman might possibly communicate the intelligence to Mr. Pickwick,\\r\\nwho would certainly lose no time in transmitting it to the local\\r\\nauthorities, and thus prevent the killing or maiming of his follower.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were his thoughts when he returned to the coffee-room, and\\r\\nintimated his intention of accepting the doctor’s challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Will you refer me to a friend, to arrange the time and place of\\r\\nmeeting?’ said the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Quite unnecessary,’ replied Mr. Winkle; ‘name them to me, and I can\\r\\nprocure the attendance of a friend afterwards.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Shall we say--sunset this evening?’ inquired the officer, in a careless\\r\\ntone.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very good,’ replied Mr. Winkle, thinking in his heart it was very bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You know Fort Pitt?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes; I saw it yesterday.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘If you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders the\\r\\ntrench, take the foot-path to the left when you arrive at an angle of\\r\\nthe fortification, and keep straight on, till you see me, I will precede\\r\\nyou to a secluded place, where the affair can be conducted without fear\\r\\nof interruption.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Fear of interruption!’ thought Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nothing more to arrange, I think,’ said the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I am not aware of anything more,’ replied Mr. Winkle. ‘Good-morning.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Good-morning;’ and the officer whistled a lively air as he strode away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat morning’s breakfast passed heavily off. Mr. Tupman was not in a\\r\\ncondition to rise, after the unwonted dissipation of the previous night;\\r\\nMr. Snodgrass appeared to labour under a poetical depression of spirits;\\r\\nand even Mr. Pickwick evinced an unusual attachment to silence and soda-\\r\\nwater. Mr. Winkle eagerly watched his opportunity: it was not long\\r\\nwanting. Mr. Snodgrass proposed a visit to the castle, and as Mr. Winkle\\r\\nwas the only other member of the party disposed to walk, they went out\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Snodgrass,’ said Mr. Winkle, when they had turned out of the public\\r\\nstreet.’Snodgrass, my dear fellow, can I rely upon your secrecy?’ As he\\r\\nsaid this, he most devoutly and earnestly hoped he could not.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You can,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass. ‘Hear me swear--’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No, no,’ interrupted Winkle, terrified at the idea of his companion’s\\r\\nunconsciously pledging himself not to give information; ‘don’t swear,\\r\\ndon’t swear; it’s quite unnecessary.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Snodgrass dropped the hand which he had, in the spirit of poesy,\\r\\nraised towards the clouds as he made the above appeal, and assumed an\\r\\nattitude of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I want your assistance, my dear fellow, in an affair of honour,’ said\\r\\nMr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You shall have it,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass, clasping his friend’s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘With a doctor--Doctor Slammer, of the 97th,’ said Mr. Winkle, wishing\\r\\nto make the matter appear as solemn as possible; ‘an affair with an\\r\\nofficer, seconded by another officer, at sunset this evening, in a\\r\\nlonely field beyond Fort Pitt.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I will attend you,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was astonished, but by no means dismayed. It is extraordinary how\\r\\ncool any party but the principal can be in such cases. Mr. Winkle had\\r\\nforgotten this. He had judged of his friend’s feelings by his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The consequences may be dreadful,’ said Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I hope not,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The doctor, I believe, is a very good shot,’ said Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Most of these military men are,’ observed Mr. Snodgrass calmly; ‘but so\\r\\nare you, ain’t you?’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Winkle replied in the affirmative; and perceiving that he had not\\r\\nalarmed his companion sufficiently, changed his ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Snodgrass,’ he said, in a voice tremulous with emotion, ‘if I fall, you\\r\\nwill find in a packet which I shall place in your hands a note for my--\\r\\nfor my father.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThis attack was a failure also. Mr. Snodgrass was affected, but he\\r\\nundertook the delivery of the note as readily as if he had been a\\r\\ntwopenny postman.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘If I fall,’ said Mr. Winkle, ‘or if the doctor falls, you, my dear\\r\\nfriend, will be tried as an accessory before the fact. Shall I involve\\r\\nmy friend in transportation--possibly for life!’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Snodgrass winced a little at this, but his heroism was invincible.\\r\\n‘In the cause of friendship,’ he fervently exclaimed, ‘I would brave all\\r\\ndangers.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Mr. Winkle cursed his companion’s devoted friendship internally, as\\r\\nthey walked silently along, side by side, for some minutes, each\\r\\nimmersed in his own meditations! The morning was wearing away; he grew\\r\\ndesperate.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Snodgrass,’ he said, stopping suddenly, ‘do not let me be balked in\\r\\nthis matter--do not give information to the local authorities--do not\\r\\nobtain the assistance of several peace officers, to take either me or\\r\\nDoctor Slammer, of the 97th Regiment, at present quartered in Chatham\\r\\nBarracks, into custody, and thus prevent this duel!--I say, do not.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Snodgrass seized his friend’s hand warmly, as he enthusiastically\\r\\nreplied, ‘Not for worlds!’\\r\\n\\r\\nA thrill passed over Mr. Winkle’s frame as the conviction that he had\\r\\nnothing to hope from his friend’s fears, and that he was destined to\\r\\nbecome an animated target, rushed forcibly upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state of the case having been formally explained to Mr. Snodgrass,\\r\\nand a case of satisfactory pistols, with the satisfactory accompaniments\\r\\nof powder, ball, and caps, having been hired from a manufacturer in\\r\\nRochester, the two friends returned to their inn; Mr. Winkle to ruminate\\r\\non the approaching struggle, and Mr. Snodgrass to arrange the weapons of\\r\\nwar, and put them into proper order for immediate use.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a dull and heavy evening when they again sallied forth on their\\r\\nawkward errand. Mr. Winkle was muffled up in a huge cloak to escape\\r\\nobservation, and Mr. Snodgrass bore under his the instruments of\\r\\ndestruction.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Have you got everything?’ said Mr. Winkle, in an agitated tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Everything,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass; ‘plenty of ammunition, in case the\\r\\nshots don’t take effect. There’s a quarter of a pound of powder in the\\r\\ncase, and I have got two newspapers in my pocket for the loadings.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were instances of friendship for which any man might reasonably\\r\\nfeel most grateful. The presumption is, that the gratitude of Mr. Winkle\\r\\nwas too powerful for utterance, as he said nothing, but continued to\\r\\nwalk on--rather slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We are in excellent time,’ said Mr. Snodgrass, as they climbed the\\r\\nfence of the first field; ‘the sun is just going down.’ Mr. Winkle\\r\\nlooked up at the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability\\r\\nof his ‘going down’ himself, before long.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There’s the officer,’ exclaimed Mr. Winkle, after a few minutes\\r\\nwalking.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Where?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There--the gentleman in the blue cloak.’ Mr. Snodgrass looked in the\\r\\ndirection indicated by the forefinger of his friend, and observed a\\r\\nfigure, muffled up, as he had described. The officer evinced his\\r\\nconsciousness of their presence by slightly beckoning with his hand; and\\r\\nthe two friends followed him at a little distance, as he walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening grew more dull every moment, and a melancholy wind sounded\\r\\nthrough the deserted fields, like a distant giant whistling for his\\r\\nhouse-dog. The sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the\\r\\nfeelings of Mr. Winkle. He started as they passed the angle of the\\r\\ntrench--it looked like a colossal grave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer turned suddenly from the path, and after climbing a paling,\\r\\nand scaling a hedge, entered a secluded field. Two gentlemen were\\r\\nwaiting in it; one was a little, fat man, with black hair; and the\\r\\nother--a portly personage in a braided surtout--was sitting with perfect\\r\\nequanimity on a camp-stool.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The other party, and a surgeon, I suppose,’ said Mr. Snodgrass; ‘take a\\r\\ndrop of brandy.’ Mr. Winkle seized the wicker bottle which his friend\\r\\nproffered, and took a lengthened pull at the exhilarating liquid.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My friend, Sir, Mr. Snodgrass,’ said Mr. Winkle, as the officer\\r\\napproached. Doctor Slammer’s friend bowed, and produced a case similar\\r\\nto that which Mr. Snodgrass carried.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We have nothing further to say, Sir, I think,’ he coldly remarked, as\\r\\nhe opened the case; ‘an apology has been resolutely declined.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nothing, Sir,’ said Mr. Snodgrass, who began to feel rather\\r\\nuncomfortable himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Will you step forward?’ said the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Certainly,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass. The ground was measured, and\\r\\npreliminaries arranged.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You will find these better than your own,’ said the opposite second,\\r\\nproducing his pistols. ‘You saw me load them. Do you object to use\\r\\nthem?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Certainly not,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass. The offer relieved him from\\r\\nconsiderable embarrassment, for his previous notions of loading a pistol\\r\\nwere rather vague and undefined.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We may place our men, then, I think,’ observed the officer, with as\\r\\nmuch indifference as if the principals were chess-men, and the seconds\\r\\nplayers.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I think we may,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass; who would have assented to any\\r\\nproposition, because he knew nothing about the matter. The officer\\r\\ncrossed to Doctor Slammer, and Mr. Snodgrass went up to Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It’s all ready,’ said he, offering the pistol. ‘Give me your cloak.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You have got the packet, my dear fellow,’ said poor Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘All right,’ said Mr. Snodgrass. ‘Be steady, and wing him.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIt occurred to Mr. Winkle that this advice was very like that which\\r\\nbystanders invariably give to the smallest boy in a street fight,\\r\\nnamely, ‘Go in, and win’--an admirable thing to recommend, if you only\\r\\nknow how to do it. He took off his cloak, however, in silence--it always\\r\\ntook a long time to undo that cloak--and accepted the pistol. The\\r\\nseconds retired, the gentleman on the camp-stool did the same, and the\\r\\nbelligerents approached each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Winkle was always remarkable for extreme humanity. It is conjectured\\r\\nthat his unwillingness to hurt a fellow-creature intentionally was the\\r\\ncause of his shutting his eyes when he arrived at the fatal spot; and\\r\\nthat the circumstance of his eyes being closed, prevented his observing\\r\\nthe very extraordinary and unaccountable demeanour of Doctor Slammer.\\r\\nThat gentleman started, stared, retreated, rubbed his eyes, stared\\r\\nagain, and, finally, shouted, ‘Stop, stop!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What’s all this?’ said Doctor Slammer, as his friend and Mr. Snodgrass\\r\\ncame running up; ‘that’s not the man.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not the man!’ said Doctor Slammer’s second.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not the man!’ said Mr. Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Not the man!’ said the gentleman with the camp-stool in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Certainly not,’ replied the little doctor. ‘That’s not the person who\\r\\ninsulted me last night.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very extraordinary!’ exclaimed the officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Very,’ said the gentleman with the camp-stool. ‘The only question is,\\r\\nwhether the gentleman, being on the ground, must not be considered, as a\\r\\nmatter of form, to be the individual who insulted our friend, Doctor\\r\\nSlammer, yesterday evening, whether he is really that individual or\\r\\nnot;’ and having delivered this suggestion, with a very sage and\\r\\nmysterious air, the man with the camp-stool took a large pinch of snuff,\\r\\nand looked profoundly round, with the air of an authority in such\\r\\nmatters.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Mr. Winkle had opened his eyes, and his ears too, when he heard his\\r\\nadversary call out for a cessation of hostilities; and perceiving by\\r\\nwhat he had afterwards said that there was, beyond all question, some\\r\\nmistake in the matter, he at once foresaw the increase of reputation he\\r\\nshould inevitably acquire by concealing the real motive of his coming\\r\\nout; he therefore stepped boldly forward, and said--\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I am not the person. I know it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Then, that,’ said the man with the camp-stool, ‘is an affront to Doctor\\r\\nSlammer, and a sufficient reason for proceeding immediately.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Pray be quiet, Payne,’ said the doctor’s second. ‘Why did you not\\r\\ncommunicate this fact to me this morning, Sir?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘To be sure--to be sure,’ said the man with the camp-stool indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I entreat you to be quiet, Payne,’ said the other. ‘May I repeat my\\r\\nquestion, Sir?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Because, Sir,’ replied Mr. Winkle, who had had time to deliberate upon\\r\\nhis answer, ‘because, Sir, you described an intoxicated and\\r\\nungentlemanly person as wearing a coat which I have the honour, not only\\r\\nto wear but to have invented--the proposed uniform, Sir, of the Pickwick\\r\\nClub in London. The honour of that uniform I feel bound to maintain, and\\r\\nI therefore, without inquiry, accepted the challenge which you offered\\r\\nme.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My dear Sir,’ said the good-humoured little doctor advancing with\\r\\nextended hand, ‘I honour your gallantry. Permit me to say, Sir, that I\\r\\nhighly admire your conduct, and extremely regret having caused you the\\r\\ninconvenience of this meeting, to no purpose.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I beg you won’t mention it, Sir,’ said Mr. Winkle.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I shall feel proud of your acquaintance, Sir,’ said the little doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you, sir,’ replied Mr.\\r\\nWinkle. Thereupon the doctor and Mr. Winkle shook hands, and then Mr.\\r\\nWinkle and Lieutenant Tappleton (the doctor’s second), and then Mr.\\r\\nWinkle and the man with the camp-stool, and, finally, Mr. Winkle and Mr.\\r\\nSnodgrass--the last-named gentleman in an excess of admiration at the\\r\\nnoble conduct of his heroic friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I think we may adjourn,’ said Lieutenant Tappleton.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Certainly,’ added the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Unless,’ interposed the man with the camp-stool, ‘unless Mr. Winkle\\r\\nfeels himself aggrieved by the challenge; in which case, I submit, he\\r\\nhas a right to satisfaction.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Winkle, with great self-denial, expressed himself quite satisfied\\r\\nalready.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Or possibly,’ said the man with the camp-stool, ‘the gentleman’s second\\r\\nmay feel himself affronted with some observations which fell from me at\\r\\nan early period of this meeting; if so, I shall be happy to give him\\r\\nsatisfaction immediately.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Snodgrass hastily professed himself very much obliged with the\\r\\nhandsome offer of the gentleman who had spoken last, which he was only\\r\\ninduced to decline by his entire contentment with the whole proceedings.\\r\\nThe two seconds adjusted the cases, and the whole party left the ground\\r\\nin a much more lively manner than they had proceeded to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Do you remain long here?’ inquired Doctor Slammer of Mr. Winkle, as\\r\\nthey walked on most amicably together.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I think we shall leave here the day after to-morrow,’ was the reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I trust I shall have the pleasure of seeing you and your friend at my\\r\\nrooms, and of spending a pleasant evening with you, after this awkward\\r\\nmistake,’ said the little doctor; ‘are you disengaged this evening?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘We have some friends here,’ replied Mr. Winkle, ‘and I should not like\\r\\nto leave them to-night. Perhaps you and your friend will join us at the\\r\\nBull.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘With great pleasure,’ said the little doctor; ‘will ten o’clock be too\\r\\nlate to look in for half an hour?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh dear, no,’ said Mr. Winkle. ‘I shall be most happy to introduce you\\r\\nto my friends, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘It will give me great pleasure, I am sure,’ replied Doctor Slammer,\\r\\nlittle suspecting who Mr. Tupman was.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘You will be sure to come?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh, certainly.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time they had reached the road. Cordial farewells were\\r\\nexchanged, and the party separated. Doctor Slammer and his friends\\r\\nrepaired to the barracks, and Mr. Winkle, accompanied by Mr. Snodgrass,\\r\\nreturned to their inn.\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeff\\r\\nA TRAMP ABROAD, Part 1\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\n[The Knighted Knave of Bergen]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day it occurred to me that it had been many years since the world\\r\\nhad been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake\\r\\na journey through Europe on foot. After much thought, I decided that\\r\\nI was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle. So I\\r\\ndetermined to do it. This was in March, 1878.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the\\r\\ncapacity of agent, and finally hired a Mr. Harris for this service.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was also my purpose to study art while in Europe. Mr. Harris was in\\r\\nsympathy with me in this. He was as much of an enthusiast in art as\\r\\nI was, and not less anxious to learn to paint. I desired to learn the\\r\\nGerman language; so did Harris.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the middle of April we sailed in the HOLSATIA, Captain Brandt,\\r\\nand had a very pleasant trip, indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a brief rest at Hamburg, we made preparations for a long\\r\\npedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather, but at the\\r\\nlast moment we changed the program, for private reasons, and took the\\r\\nexpress-train.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made a short halt at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and found it an\\r\\ninteresting city. I would have liked to visit the birthplace of\\r\\nGutenburg, but it could not be done, as no memorandum of the site of the\\r\\nhouse has been kept. So we spent an hour in the Goethe mansion instead.\\r\\nThe city permits this house to belong to private parties, instead\\r\\nof gracing and dignifying herself with the honor of possessing and\\r\\nprotecting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of\\r\\nbeing the place where the following incident occurred. Charlemagne,\\r\\nwhile chasing the Saxons (as HE said), or being chased by them (as THEY\\r\\nsaid), arrived at the bank of the river at dawn, in a fog. The enemy\\r\\nwere either before him or behind him; but in any case he wanted to get\\r\\nacross, very badly. He would have given anything for a guide, but none\\r\\nwas to be had. Presently he saw a deer, followed by her young, approach\\r\\nthe water. He watched her, judging that she would seek a ford, and he\\r\\nwas right. She waded over, and the army followed. So a great Frankish\\r\\nvictory or defeat was gained or avoided; and in order to commemorate the\\r\\nepisode, Charlemagne commanded a city to be built there, which he named\\r\\nFrankfort--the ford of the Franks. None of the other cities where this\\r\\nevent happened were named for it. This is good evidence that Frankfort\\r\\nwas the first place it occurred at.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrankfort has another distinction--it is the birthplace of the German\\r\\nalphabet; or at least of the German word for alphabet --BUCHSTABEN.\\r\\nThey say that the first movable types were made on birch\\r\\nsticks--BUCHSTABE--hence the name.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was taught a lesson in political economy in Frankfort. I had brought\\r\\nfrom home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars. By way of\\r\\nexperiment, I stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street,\\r\\ntook four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars, and\\r\\nlaid down a silver piece worth 48 cents. The man gave me 43 cents\\r\\nchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Frankfort everybody wears clean clothes, and I think we noticed that\\r\\nthis strange thing was the case in Hamburg, too, and in the villages\\r\\nalong the road. Even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient\\r\\nquarters of Frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule. The little\\r\\nchildren of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a\\r\\nbody’s lap. And as for the uniforms of the soldiers, they were newness\\r\\nand brightness carried to perfection. One could never detect a smirch\\r\\nor a grain of dust upon them. The street-car conductors and drivers wore\\r\\npretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox, and their\\r\\nmanners were as fine as their clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one of the shops I had the luck to stumble upon a book which has\\r\\ncharmed me nearly to death. It is entitled THE LEGENDS OF THE RHINE FROM\\r\\nBASLE TO ROTTERDAM, by F. J. Kiefer; translated by L. W. Garnham, B.A.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll tourists MENTION the Rhine legends--in that sort of way which\\r\\nquietly pretends that the mentioner has been familiar with them all his\\r\\nlife, and that the reader cannot possibly be ignorant of them--but no\\r\\ntourist ever TELLS them. So this little book fed me in a very hungry\\r\\nplace; and I, in my turn, intend to feed my reader, with one or\\r\\ntwo little lunches from the same larder. I shall not mar Garnham’s\\r\\ntranslation by meddling with its English; for the most toothsome thing\\r\\nabout it is its quaint fashion of building English sentences on the\\r\\nGerman plan--and punctuating them accordingly to no plan at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the chapter devoted to “Legends of Frankfort,” I find the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n“THE KNAVE OF BERGEN” “In Frankfort at the Romer was a great mask-ball,\\r\\nat the coronation festival, and in the illuminated saloon, the clanging\\r\\nmusic invited to dance, and splendidly appeared the rich toilets and\\r\\ncharms of the ladies, and the festively costumed Princes and Knights.\\r\\nAll seemed pleasure, joy, and roguish gaiety, only one of the numerous\\r\\nguests had a gloomy exterior; but exactly the black armor in which he\\r\\nwalked about excited general attention, and his tall figure, as well as\\r\\nthe noble propriety of his movements, attracted especially the regards\\r\\nof the ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWho the Knight was? Nobody could guess, for his Vizier was well closed,\\r\\nand nothing made him recognizable. Proud and yet modest he advanced to\\r\\nthe Empress; bowed on one knee before her seat, and begged for the favor\\r\\nof a waltz with the Queen of the festival. And she allowed his request.\\r\\nWith light and graceful steps he danced through the long saloon, with\\r\\nthe sovereign who thought never to have found a more dexterous and\\r\\nexcellent dancer. But also by the grace of his manner, and fine\\r\\nconversation he knew to win the Queen, and she graciously accorded him\\r\\na second dance for which he begged, a third, and a fourth, as well as\\r\\nothers were not refused him. How all regarded the happy dancer, how\\r\\nmany envied him the high favor; how increased curiosity, who the masked\\r\\nknight could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Also the Emperor became more and more excited with curiosity, and with\\r\\ngreat suspense one awaited the hour, when according to mask-law, each\\r\\nmasked guest must make himself known. This moment came, but although all\\r\\nother unmasked; the secret knight still refused to allow his features\\r\\nto be seen, till at last the Queen driven by curiosity, and vexed at the\\r\\nobstinate refusal; commanded him to open his Vizier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened it, and none of the high ladies and knights knew him. But from\\r\\nthe crowded spectators, 2 officials advanced, who recognized the black\\r\\ndancer, and horror and terror spread in the saloon, as they said who the\\r\\nsupposed knight was. It was the executioner of Bergen. But glowing with\\r\\nrage, the King commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death,\\r\\nwho had ventured to dance, with the queen; so disgraced the Empress,\\r\\nand insulted the crown. The culpable threw himself at the Emperor, and\\r\\nsaid--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Indeed I have heavily sinned against all noble guests assembled here,\\r\\nbut most heavily against you my sovereign and my queen. The Queen is\\r\\ninsulted by my haughtiness equal to treason, but no punishment even\\r\\nblood, will not be able to wash out the disgrace, which you have\\r\\nsuffered by me. Therefore oh King! allow me to propose a remedy, to\\r\\nefface the shame, and to render it as if not done. Draw your sword and\\r\\nknight me, then I will throw down my gauntlet, to everyone who dares to\\r\\nspeak disrespectfully of my king.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Emperor was surprised at this bold proposal, however it appeared\\r\\nthe wisest to him; ‘You are a knave,’ he replied after a moment’s\\r\\nconsideration, ‘however your advice is good, and displays prudence, as\\r\\nyour offense shows adventurous courage. Well then,’ and gave him the\\r\\nknight-stroke ‘so I raise you to nobility, who begged for grace for your\\r\\noffense now kneels before me, rise as knight; knavish you have acted,\\r\\nand Knave of Bergen shall you be called henceforth,’ and gladly the\\r\\nBlack knight rose; three cheers were given in honor of the Emperor, and\\r\\nloud cries of joy testified the approbation with which the Queen danced\\r\\nstill once with the Knave of Bergen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nHeidelberg\\r\\n\\r\\n[Landing a Monarch at Heidelberg]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stopped at a hotel by the railway-station. Next morning, as we sat in\\r\\nmy room waiting for breakfast to come up, we got a good deal interested\\r\\nin something which was going on over the way, in front of another hotel.\\r\\nFirst, the personage who is called the PORTIER (who is not the PORTER,\\r\\nbut is a sort of first-mate of a hotel) [1. See Appendix A] appeared\\r\\nat the door in a spick-and-span new blue cloth uniform, decorated with\\r\\nshining brass buttons, and with bands of gold lace around his cap and\\r\\nwristbands; and he wore white gloves, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shed an official glance upon the situation, and then began to give\\r\\norders. Two women-servants came out with pails and brooms and brushes,\\r\\nand gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing; meanwhile two others\\r\\nscrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door; beyond these we\\r\\ncould see some men-servants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase.\\r\\nThis carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and\\r\\nbanged and swept out of it; then brought back and put down again. The\\r\\nbrass stair-rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to\\r\\ntheir places. Now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming\\r\\nplants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the\\r\\nbase of the staircase. Other servants adorned all the balconies of the\\r\\nvarious stories with flowers and banners; others ascended to the\\r\\nroof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there. Now came some more\\r\\nchamber-maids and retouched the sidewalk, and afterward wiped the marble\\r\\nsteps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather\\r\\nbrushes. Now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the\\r\\nmarble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone. The PORTIER\\r\\ncast his eye along it, and found it was not absolutely straight; he\\r\\ncommanded it to be straightened; the servants made the effort--made\\r\\nseveral efforts, in fact--but the PORTIER was not satisfied. He finally\\r\\nhad it taken up, and then he put it down himself and got it right.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this stage of the proceedings, a narrow bright red carpet was\\r\\nunrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the\\r\\ncurbstone, along the center of the black carpet. This red path cost the\\r\\nPORTIER more trouble than even the black one had done. But he patiently\\r\\nfixed and refixed it until it was exactly right and lay precisely in the\\r\\nmiddle of the black carpet. In New York these performances would have\\r\\ngathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely interested spectators;\\r\\nbut here it only captured an audience of half a dozen little boys who\\r\\nstood in a row across the pavement, some with their school-knapsacks on\\r\\ntheir backs and their hands in their pockets, others with arms full of\\r\\nbundles, and all absorbed in the show. Occasionally one of them skipped\\r\\nirreverently over the carpet and took up a position on the other side.\\r\\nThis always visibly annoyed the PORTIER.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow came a waiting interval. The landlord, in plain clothes, and\\r\\nbareheaded, placed himself on the bottom marble step, abreast the\\r\\nPORTIER, who stood on the other end of the same steps; six or eight\\r\\nwaiters, gloved, bareheaded, and wearing their whitest linen, their\\r\\nwhitest cravats, and their finest swallow-tails, grouped themselves\\r\\nabout these chiefs, but leaving the carpetway clear. Nobody moved or\\r\\nspoke any more but only waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard, and\\r\\nimmediately groups of people began to gather in the street. Two or three\\r\\nopen carriages arrived, and deposited some maids of honor and some male\\r\\nofficials at the hotel. Presently another open carriage brought the\\r\\nGrand Duke of Baden, a stately man in uniform, who wore the handsome\\r\\nbrass-mounted, steel-spiked helmet of the army on his head. Last came\\r\\nthe Empress of Germany and the Grand Duchess of Baden in a closed\\r\\ncarriage; these passed through the low-bowing groups of servants and\\r\\ndisappeared in the hotel, exhibiting to us only the backs of their\\r\\nheads, and then the show was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a\\r\\nship.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as to Heidelberg. The weather was growing pretty warm,--very warm,\\r\\nin fact. So we left the valley and took quarters at the Schloss Hotel,\\r\\non the hill, above the Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorge--a gorge the shape of\\r\\na shepherd’s crook; if one looks up it he perceives that it is about\\r\\nstraight, for a mile and a half, then makes a sharp curve to the\\r\\nright and disappears. This gorge--along whose bottom pours the swift\\r\\nNeckar--is confined between (or cloven through) a couple of long, steep\\r\\nridges, a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits,\\r\\nwith the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under\\r\\ncultivation. These ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge\\r\\nand form two bold and conspicuous headlands, with Heidelberg nestling\\r\\nbetween them; from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the\\r\\nRhine valley, and into this expanse the Neckar goes wandering in shining\\r\\ncurves and is presently lost to view.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow if one turns and looks up the gorge once more, he will see the\\r\\nSchloss Hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the\\r\\nNeckar--a precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with\\r\\nfoliage that no glimpse of the rock appears. The building seems very\\r\\nairily situated. It has the appearance of being on a shelf half-way\\r\\nup the wooded mountainside; and as it is remote and isolated, and very\\r\\nwhite, it makes a strong mark against the lofty leafy rampart at its\\r\\nback.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty, and one which\\r\\nmight be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a\\r\\ncommanding situation. This feature may be described as a series of\\r\\nglass-enclosed parlors CLINGING TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE, one against\\r\\neach and every bed-chamber and drawing-room. They are like long, narrow,\\r\\nhigh-ceiled bird-cages hung against the building. My room was a corner\\r\\nroom, and had two of these things, a north one and a west one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the north cage one looks up the Neckar gorge; from the west one he\\r\\nlooks down it. This last affords the most extensive view, and it is one\\r\\nof the loveliest that can be imagined, too. Out of a billowy upheaval\\r\\nof vivid green foliage, a rifle-shot removed, rises the huge ruin\\r\\nof Heidelberg Castle, [2. See Appendix B] with empty window arches,\\r\\nivy-mailed battlements, moldering towers--the Lear of inanimate\\r\\nnature--deserted, discrowned, beaten by the storms, but royal still,\\r\\nand beautiful. It is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly\\r\\nstrike the leafy declivity at the Castle’s base and dash up it and\\r\\ndrench it as with a luminous spray, while the adjacent groves are in\\r\\ndeep shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the Castle swells a great dome-shaped hill, forest-clad, and\\r\\nbeyond that a nobler and loftier one. The Castle looks down upon the\\r\\ncompact brown-roofed town; and from the town two picturesque old bridges\\r\\nspan the river. Now the view broadens; through the gateway of the\\r\\nsentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide Rhine plain, which\\r\\nstretches away, softly and richly tinted, grows gradually and dreamily\\r\\nindistinct, and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm\\r\\nabout it as this one gives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first night we were there, we went to bed and to sleep early; but\\r\\nI awoke at the end of two or three hours, and lay a comfortable while\\r\\nlistening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony\\r\\nwindows. I took it to be rain, but it turned out to be only the murmur\\r\\nof the restless Neckar, tumbling over her dikes and dams far below, in\\r\\nthe gorge. I got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful\\r\\nsight. Away down on the level under the black mass of the Castle, the\\r\\ntown lay, stretched along the river, its intricate cobweb of streets\\r\\njeweled with twinkling lights; there were rows of lights on the bridges;\\r\\nthese flung lances of light upon the water, in the black shadows of the\\r\\narches; and away at the extremity of all this fairy spectacle blinked\\r\\nand glowed a massed multitude of gas-jets which seemed to cover acres of\\r\\nground; it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread\\r\\nout there. I did not know before, that a half-mile of sextuple\\r\\nrailway-tracks could be made such an adornment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thinks Heidelberg by day--with its surroundings--is the last\\r\\npossibility of the beautiful; but when he sees Heidelberg by night, a\\r\\nfallen Milky Way, with that glittering railway constellation pinned to\\r\\nthe border, he requires time to consider upon the verdict.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all\\r\\nthese lofty Neckar hills to their tops. The great deeps of a boundless\\r\\nforest have a beguiling and impressive charm in any country; but German\\r\\nlegends and fairy tales have given these an added charm. They have\\r\\npeopled all that region with gnomes, and dwarfs, and all sorts of\\r\\nmysterious and uncanny creatures. At the time I am writing of, I had\\r\\nbeen reading so much of this literature that sometimes I was not sure\\r\\nbut I was beginning to believe in the gnomes and fairies as realities.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne afternoon I got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel, and\\r\\npresently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk,\\r\\nand kobolds, and enchanted folk, and the rest of the pleasant legendary\\r\\nstuff; and so, by stimulating my fancy, I finally got to imagining I\\r\\nglimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the columned\\r\\naisles of the forest. It was a place which was peculiarly meet for the\\r\\noccasion. It was a pine wood, with so thick and soft a carpet of brown\\r\\nneedles that one’s footfall made no more sound than if he were treading\\r\\non wool; the tree-trunks were as round and straight and smooth as\\r\\npillars, and stood close together; they were bare of branches to a point\\r\\nabout twenty-five feet above-ground, and from there upward so thick with\\r\\nboughs that not a ray of sunlight could pierce through. The world was\\r\\nbright with sunshine outside, but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in\\r\\nthere, and also a deep silence so profound that I seemed to hear my own\\r\\nbreathings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had stood ten minutes, thinking and imagining, and getting\\r\\nmy spirit in tune with the place, and in the right mood to enjoy the\\r\\nsupernatural, a raven suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head. It\\r\\nmade me start; and then I was angry because I started. I looked up, and\\r\\nthe creature was sitting on a limb right over me, looking down at me.\\r\\nI felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which\\r\\none feels when he finds that a human stranger has been clandestinely\\r\\ninspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him. I eyed\\r\\nthe raven, and the raven eyed me. Nothing was said during some seconds.\\r\\nThen the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point\\r\\nof observation, lifted his wings, stuck his head far down below his\\r\\nshoulders toward me and croaked again--a croak with a distinctly\\r\\ninsulting expression about it. If he had spoken in English he could not\\r\\nhave said any more plainly than he did say in raven, “Well, what do YOU\\r\\nwant here?” I felt as foolish as if I had been caught in some mean act\\r\\nby a responsible being, and reproved for it. However, I made no reply;\\r\\nI would not bandy words with a raven. The adversary waited a while, with\\r\\nhis shoulders still lifted, his head thrust down between them, and\\r\\nhis keen bright eye fixed on me; then he threw out two or three more\\r\\ninsults, which I could not understand, further than that I knew a\\r\\nportion of them consisted of language not used in church.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI still made no reply. Now the adversary raised his head and\\r\\ncalled. There was an answering croak from a little distance in the\\r\\nwood--evidently a croak of inquiry. The adversary explained with\\r\\nenthusiasm, and the other raven dropped everything and came. The two sat\\r\\nside by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and offensively as\\r\\ntwo great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug. The thing became\\r\\nmore and more embarrassing. They called in another friend. This was too\\r\\nmuch. I saw that they had the advantage of me, and so I concluded to get\\r\\nout of the scrape by walking out of it. They enjoyed my defeat as much\\r\\nas any low white people could have done. They craned their necks and\\r\\nlaughed at me (for a raven CAN laugh, just like a man), they squalled\\r\\ninsulting remarks after me as long as they could see me. They were\\r\\nnothing but ravens--I knew that--what they thought of me could be a\\r\\nmatter of no consequence--and yet when even a raven shouts after you,\\r\\n“What a hat!” “Oh, pull down your vest!” and that sort of thing, it\\r\\nhurts you and humiliates you, and there is no getting around it with\\r\\nfine reasoning and pretty arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals talk to each other, of course. There can be no question about\\r\\nthat; but I suppose there are very few people who can understand them.\\r\\nI never knew but one man who could. I knew he could, however, because he\\r\\ntold me so himself. He was a middle-aged, simple-hearted miner who had\\r\\nlived in a lonely corner of California, among the woods and mountains,\\r\\na good many years, and had studied the ways of his only neighbors, the\\r\\nbeasts and the birds, until he believed he could accurately translate\\r\\nany remark which they made. This was Jim Baker. According to Jim Baker,\\r\\nsome animals have only a limited education, and some use only simple\\r\\nwords, and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure; whereas,\\r\\ncertain other animals have a large vocabulary, a fine command of\\r\\nlanguage and a ready and fluent delivery; consequently these latter talk\\r\\na great deal; they like it; they are so conscious of their talent,\\r\\nand they enjoy “showing off.” Baker said, that after long and careful\\r\\nobservation, he had come to the conclusion that the bluejays were the\\r\\nbest talkers he had found among birds and beasts. Said he:\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s more TO a bluejay than any other creature. He has got more\\r\\nmoods, and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures; and,\\r\\nmind you, whatever a bluejay feels, he can put into language. And\\r\\nno mere commonplace language, either, but rattling, out-and-out\\r\\nbook-talk--and bristling with metaphor, too--just bristling! And as for\\r\\ncommand of language--why YOU never see a bluejay get stuck for a word.\\r\\nNo man ever did. They just boil out of him! And another thing: I’ve\\r\\nnoticed a good deal, and there’s no bird, or cow, or anything that uses\\r\\nas good grammar as a bluejay. You may say a cat uses good grammar. Well,\\r\\na cat does--but you let a cat get excited once; you let a cat get to\\r\\npulling fur with another cat on a shed, nights, and you’ll hear grammar\\r\\nthat will give you the lockjaw. Ignorant people think it’s the NOISE\\r\\nwhich fighting cats make that is so aggravating, but it ain’t so; it’s\\r\\nthe sickening grammar they use. Now I’ve never heard a jay use bad\\r\\ngrammar but very seldom; and when they do, they are as ashamed as a\\r\\nhuman; they shut right down and leave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may call a jay a bird. Well, so he is, in a measure--but he’s got\\r\\nfeathers on him, and don’t belong to no church, perhaps; but otherwise\\r\\nhe is just as much human as you be. And I’ll tell you for why. A jay’s\\r\\ngifts, and instincts, and feelings, and interests, cover the whole\\r\\nground. A jay hasn’t got any more principle than a Congressman. A jay\\r\\nwill lie, a jay will steal, a jay will deceive, a jay will betray; and\\r\\nfour times out of five, a jay will go back on his solemnest promise. The\\r\\nsacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you can’t cram into\\r\\nno bluejay’s head. Now, on top of all this, there’s another thing; a\\r\\njay can out-swear any gentleman in the mines. You think a cat can swear.\\r\\nWell, a cat can; but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his\\r\\nreserve-powers, and where is your cat? Don’t talk to ME--I know too much\\r\\nabout this thing; in the one little particular of scolding--just good,\\r\\nclean, out-and-out scolding--a bluejay can lay over anything, human or\\r\\ndivine. Yes, sir, a jay is everything that a man is. A jay can cry,\\r\\na jay can laugh, a jay can feel shame, a jay can reason and plan and\\r\\ndiscuss, a jay likes gossip and scandal, a jay has got a sense of humor,\\r\\na jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do--maybe better. If\\r\\na jay ain’t human, he better take in his sign, that’s all. Now I’m going\\r\\nto tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays.”\\r\\n\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeffAdventures of Huckleberry Finn\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\nYOU don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\\r\\nAdventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. \\xa0That book was made\\r\\nby Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. \\xa0There was things\\r\\nwhich he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. \\xa0That is nothing. \\xa0I\\r\\nnever seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\\r\\nPolly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. \\xa0Aunt Polly--Tom’s Aunt Polly, she\\r\\nis--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\\r\\nis mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the way that the book winds up is this: \\xa0Tom and me found the money\\r\\nthat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. \\xa0We got six\\r\\nthousand dollars apiece--all gold. \\xa0It was an awful sight of money when\\r\\nit was piled up. \\xa0Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\\r\\nat interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\\r\\nround--more than a body could tell what to do with. \\xa0The Widow Douglas\\r\\nshe took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\\r\\nrough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\\r\\nand decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand\\r\\nit no longer I lit out. \\xa0I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\\r\\nagain, and was free and satisfied. \\xa0But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\\r\\nsaid he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\\r\\nwould go back to the widow and be respectable. \\xa0So I went back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\\r\\ncalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\\r\\nit. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but\\r\\nsweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. \\xa0Well, then, the old thing\\r\\ncommenced again. \\xa0The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\\r\\nto time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but\\r\\nyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\\r\\nover the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the matter with\\r\\nthem,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. \\xa0In a\\r\\nbarrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\\r\\njuice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\\r\\nBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\\r\\nby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\\r\\nthen I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock in\\r\\ndead people.\\r\\n\\r\\nPretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. \\xa0But she\\r\\nwouldn’t. \\xa0She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must\\r\\ntry to not do it any more. \\xa0That is just the way with some people. \\xa0They\\r\\nget down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it. \\xa0Here she was\\r\\na-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\\r\\nbeing gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\\r\\nthing that had some good in it. \\xa0And she took snuff, too; of course that\\r\\nwas all right, because she done it herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\\r\\nhad just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\\r\\nspelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\\r\\nthe widow made her ease up. \\xa0I couldn’t stood it much longer. \\xa0Then for\\r\\nan hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. \\xa0Miss Watson would say,\\r\\n“Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up\\r\\nlike that, Huckleberry--set up straight;” and pretty soon she would\\r\\nsay, “Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don’t you try to\\r\\nbehave?” \\xa0Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\\r\\nI was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm. \\xa0All I wanted\\r\\nwas to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular.\\r\\n\\xa0She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for\\r\\nthe whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\\r\\n\\xa0Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\\r\\nmade up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. \\xa0But I never said so, because it\\r\\nwould only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\\r\\nplace. \\xa0She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\\r\\nday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. \\xa0So I didn’t think\\r\\nmuch of it. But I never said so. \\xa0I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\\r\\nwould go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. \\xa0I was glad\\r\\nabout that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\\r\\n\\xa0By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\\r\\neverybody was off to bed. \\xa0I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\\r\\nand put it on the table. \\xa0Then I set down in a chair by the window and\\r\\ntried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use. \\xa0I felt\\r\\nso lonesome I most wished I was dead. \\xa0The stars were shining, and the\\r\\nleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\\r\\noff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\\r\\ndog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\\r\\nto whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was, and so\\r\\nit made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\\r\\nthat kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\\r\\nsomething that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood, and so\\r\\ncan’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\\r\\ngrieving. \\xa0I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\\r\\ncompany. \\xa0Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\\r\\nflipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\\r\\nwas all shriveled up. \\xa0I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was\\r\\nan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\\r\\nand most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\\r\\ntracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\\r\\nup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. \\xa0But\\r\\nI hadn’t no confidence. \\xa0You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that\\r\\nyou’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever\\r\\nheard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed\\r\\na spider.\\r\\n\\r\\nI set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\\r\\nfor the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t\\r\\nknow. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\\r\\ngo boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\\r\\never. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\\r\\ntrees--something was a stirring. \\xa0I set still and listened. \\xa0Directly I\\r\\ncould just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. \\xa0That was good!\\r\\n\\xa0Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!” as soft as I could, and then I put out the\\r\\nlight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. \\xa0Then I slipped\\r\\ndown to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\\r\\nthere was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\nWE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\\r\\nthe widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our\\r\\nheads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\\r\\na noise. \\xa0We scrouched down and laid still. \\xa0Miss Watson’s big nigger,\\r\\nnamed Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\\r\\nclear, because there was a light behind him. \\xa0He got up and stretched\\r\\nhis neck out about a minute, listening. \\xa0Then he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who dah?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\\r\\nbetween us; we could a touched him, nearly. \\xa0Well, likely it was\\r\\nminutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close\\r\\ntogether. \\xa0There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\\r\\ndasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\\r\\nright between my shoulders. \\xa0Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch.\\r\\n\\xa0Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since. \\xa0If you are with\\r\\nthe quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t\\r\\nsleepy--if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why\\r\\nyou will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\\r\\nsays:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Say, who is you? \\xa0Whar is you? \\xa0Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n.\\r\\nWell, I know what I’s gwyne to do: \\xa0I’s gwyne to set down here and\\r\\nlisten tell I hears it agin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. \\xa0He leaned his back up\\r\\nagainst a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\\r\\none of mine. \\xa0My nose begun to itch. \\xa0It itched till the tears come into\\r\\nmy eyes. \\xa0But I dasn’t scratch. \\xa0Then it begun to itch on the inside.\\r\\nNext I got to itching underneath. \\xa0I didn’t know how I was going to set\\r\\nstill. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\\r\\nit seemed a sight longer than that. \\xa0I was itching in eleven different\\r\\nplaces now. \\xa0I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer,\\r\\nbut I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. \\xa0Just then Jim begun\\r\\nto breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was pretty soon\\r\\ncomfortable again.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and we\\r\\nwent creeping away on our hands and knees. \\xa0When we was ten foot off Tom\\r\\nwhispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. \\xa0But I said\\r\\nno; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I\\r\\nwarn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would slip\\r\\nin the kitchen and get some more. \\xa0I didn’t want him to try. \\xa0I said Jim\\r\\nmight wake up and come. \\xa0But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\\r\\nand got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\\r\\nThen we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\\r\\nTom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\\r\\nsomething on him. \\xa0I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\\r\\nso still and lonesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\\r\\nand by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\\r\\nthe house. \\xa0Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it\\r\\non a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake.\\r\\nAfterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\\r\\nand rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\\r\\nand hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. \\xa0And next time Jim told\\r\\nit he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\\r\\ntime he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\\r\\nrode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\\r\\nwas all over saddle-boils. \\xa0Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\\r\\ngot so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. \\xa0Niggers would come\\r\\nmiles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\\r\\nnigger in that country. \\xa0Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\\r\\nopen and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. \\xa0Niggers is\\r\\nalways talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\\r\\nwhenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\\r\\nJim would happen in and say, “Hm! \\xa0What you know ‘bout witches?” and\\r\\nthat nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. \\xa0Jim always kept\\r\\nthat five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\\r\\ncharm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\\r\\ncure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\\r\\nsaying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\\r\\n\\xa0Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\\r\\nhad, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn’t touch\\r\\nit, because the devil had had his hands on it. \\xa0Jim was most ruined for\\r\\na servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\\r\\nand been rode by witches.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\\r\\ninto the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\\r\\nthere was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\\r\\nso fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\\r\\nawful still and grand. \\xa0We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\\r\\nBen Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\\r\\n\\xa0So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\\r\\nto the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\\r\\nsecret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\\r\\npart of the bushes. \\xa0Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\\r\\nhands and knees. \\xa0We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\\r\\nopened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\\r\\nunder a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole. \\xa0We\\r\\nwent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\\r\\nsweaty and cold, and there we stopped. \\xa0Tom says:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang.\\r\\nEverybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\\r\\nin blood.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody was willing. \\xa0So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\\r\\nwrote the oath on, and read it. \\xa0It swore every boy to stick to the\\r\\nband, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\\r\\nany boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\\r\\nhis family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he\\r\\nhad killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\\r\\nof the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that\\r\\nmark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\\r\\nkilled. \\xa0And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\\r\\nmust have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\\r\\nashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\\r\\nblood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\\r\\nand be forgot forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\\r\\nit out of his own head. \\xa0He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\\r\\npirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\\r\\nthe secrets. \\xa0Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\\r\\nit in. Then Ben Rogers says:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ‘bout\\r\\nhim?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days. \\xa0He\\r\\nused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seen\\r\\nin these parts for a year or more.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\\r\\nsaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\\r\\nwouldn’t be fair and square for the others. \\xa0Well, nobody could think of\\r\\nanything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still. \\xa0I was most ready\\r\\nto cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\\r\\nWatson--they could kill her. \\xa0Everybody said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, she’ll do. \\xa0That’s all right. \\xa0Huck can come in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\\r\\nand I made my mark on the paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,”\\r\\n says Tom Sawyer.  “We ain’t burglars. \\xa0That ain’t no sort of style. \\xa0We\\r\\nare highwaymen. \\xa0We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\\r\\non, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Must we always kill the people?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, certainly. \\xa0It’s best. \\xa0Some authorities think different, but\\r\\nmostly it’s considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to\\r\\nthe cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ransomed? \\xa0What’s that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know. \\xa0But that’s what they do. \\xa0I’ve seen it in books; and so\\r\\nof course that’s what we’ve got to do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, blame it all, we’ve _got_ to do it. \\xa0Don’t I tell you it’s in the\\r\\nbooks? \\xa0Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books,\\r\\nand get things all muddled up?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation\\r\\nare these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it\\r\\nto them?--that’s the thing I want to get at. \\xa0Now, what do you reckon it\\r\\nis?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I don’t know. \\xa0But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed,\\r\\nit means that we keep them till they’re dead.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, that’s something _like_. \\xa0That’ll answer. \\xa0Why couldn’t you said\\r\\nthat before? \\xa0We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a\\r\\nbothersome lot they’ll be, too--eating up everything, and always trying\\r\\nto get loose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How you talk, Ben Rogers. \\xa0How can they get loose when there’s a guard\\r\\nover them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A guard! \\xa0Well, that _is_ good. \\xa0So somebody’s got to set up all night\\r\\nand never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. \\xa0I think that’s\\r\\nfoolishness. Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as\\r\\nthey get here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because it ain’t in the books so--that’s why. \\xa0Now, Ben Rogers, do you\\r\\nwant to do things regular, or don’t you?--that’s the idea. \\xa0Don’t you\\r\\nreckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct\\r\\nthing to do? \\xa0Do you reckon _you_ can learn ‘em anything? \\xa0Not by a good\\r\\ndeal. No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right. \\xa0I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow. \\xa0Say, do\\r\\nwe kill the women, too?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on. \\xa0Kill\\r\\nthe women? \\xa0No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. \\xa0You\\r\\nfetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them;\\r\\nand by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any\\r\\nmore.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it.\\r\\nMighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows\\r\\nwaiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers.\\r\\nBut go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was\\r\\nscared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’t\\r\\nwant to be a robber any more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him\\r\\nmad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. \\xa0But\\r\\nTom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and\\r\\nmeet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted\\r\\nto begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it\\r\\non Sunday, and that settled the thing. \\xa0They agreed to get together and\\r\\nfix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first\\r\\ncaptain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was\\r\\nbreaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was\\r\\ndog-tired.\\r\\n\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\ufeffLife on the Mississipi\\r\\nCHAPTER 1\\r\\n\\r\\nThe River and Its History\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE Mississippi is well worth reading about. It is not a commonplace\\r\\nriver, but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable. Considering the\\r\\nMissouri its main branch, it is the longest river in the world--four\\r\\nthousand three hundred miles. It seems safe to say that it is also the\\r\\ncrookedest river in the world, since in one part of its journey it uses\\r\\nup one thousand three hundred miles to cover the same ground that the\\r\\ncrow would fly over in six hundred and seventy-five. It discharges three\\r\\ntimes as much water as the St. Lawrence, twenty-five times as much\\r\\nas the Rhine, and three hundred and thirty-eight times as much as the\\r\\nThames. No other river has so vast a drainage-basin: it draws its water\\r\\nsupply from twenty-eight States and Territories; from Delaware, on the\\r\\nAtlantic seaboard, and from all the country between that and Idaho on\\r\\nthe Pacific slope--a spread of forty-five degrees of longitude. The\\r\\nMississippi receives and carries to the Gulf water from fifty-four\\r\\nsubordinate rivers that are navigable by steamboats, and from some\\r\\nhundreds that are navigable by flats and keels. The area of its\\r\\ndrainage-basin is as great as the combined areas of England, Wales,\\r\\nScotland, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy,\\r\\nand Turkey; and almost all this wide region is fertile; the Mississippi\\r\\nvalley, proper, is exceptionally so.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a remarkable river in this: that instead of widening toward its\\r\\nmouth, it grows narrower; grows narrower and deeper. From the junction\\r\\nof the Ohio to a point half way down to the sea, the width averages a\\r\\nmile in high water: thence to the sea the width steadily diminishes,\\r\\nuntil, at the ‘Passes,’ above the mouth, it is but little over half\\r\\na mile. At the junction of the Ohio the Mississippi’s depth is\\r\\neighty-seven feet; the depth increases gradually, reaching one hundred\\r\\nand twenty-nine just above the mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference in rise and fall is also remarkable--not in the upper,\\r\\nbut in the lower river. The rise is tolerably uniform down to Natchez\\r\\n(three hundred and sixty miles above the mouth)--about fifty feet.\\r\\nBut at Bayou La Fourche the river rises only twenty-four feet; at New\\r\\nOrleans only fifteen, and just above the mouth only two and one half.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn article in the New Orleans ‘Times-Democrat,’ based upon reports of\\r\\nable engineers, states that the river annually empties four hundred and\\r\\nsix million tons of mud into the Gulf of Mexico--which brings to mind\\r\\nCaptain Marryat’s rude name for the Mississippi--‘the Great Sewer.’ This\\r\\nmud, solidified, would make a mass a mile square and two hundred and\\r\\nforty-one feet high.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mud deposit gradually extends the land--but only gradually; it has\\r\\nextended it not quite a third of a mile in the two hundred years which\\r\\nhave elapsed since the river took its place in history. The belief of\\r\\nthe scientific people is, that the mouth used to be at Baton Rouge,\\r\\nwhere the hills cease, and that the two hundred miles of land between\\r\\nthere and the Gulf was built by the river. This gives us the age of that\\r\\npiece of country, without any trouble at all--one hundred and twenty\\r\\nthousand years. Yet it is much the youthfullest batch of country that\\r\\nlies around there anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mississippi is remarkable in still another way--its disposition to\\r\\nmake prodigious jumps by cutting through narrow necks of land, and thus\\r\\nstraightening and shortening itself. More than once it has shortened\\r\\nitself thirty miles at a single jump! These cut-offs have had curious\\r\\neffects: they have thrown several river towns out into the rural\\r\\ndistricts, and built up sand bars and forests in front of them. The town\\r\\nof Delta used to be three miles below Vicksburg: a recent cutoff has\\r\\nradically changed the position, and Delta is now _two miles above_\\r\\nVicksburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these river towns have been retired to the country by that\\r\\ncut-off. A cut-off plays havoc with boundary lines and jurisdictions:\\r\\nfor instance, a man is living in the State of Mississippi to-day, a\\r\\ncut-off occurs to-night, and to-morrow the man finds himself and his\\r\\nland over on the other side of the river, within the boundaries and\\r\\nsubject to the laws of the State of Louisiana! Such a thing, happening\\r\\nin the upper river in the old times, could have transferred a slave from\\r\\nMissouri to Illinois and made a free man of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mississippi does not alter its locality by cut-offs alone: it\\r\\nis always changing its habitat _bodily_--is always moving bodily\\r\\n_sidewise_. At Hard Times, La., the river is two miles west of the\\r\\nregion it used to occupy. As a result, the original _site _of that\\r\\nsettlement is not now in Louisiana at all, but on the other side of\\r\\nthe river, in the State of Mississippi. _Nearly the whole of that one\\r\\nthousand three hundred miles of old mississippi river which la salle\\r\\nfloated down in his canoes, two hundred years ago, is good solid dry\\r\\nground now_. The river lies to the right of it, in places, and to the\\r\\nleft of it in other places.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Mississippi’s mud builds land but slowly, down at the\\r\\nmouth, where the Gulfs billows interfere with its work, it builds fast\\r\\nenough in better protected regions higher up: for instance, Prophet’s\\r\\nIsland contained one thousand five hundred acres of land thirty years\\r\\nago; since then the river has added seven hundred acres to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut enough of these examples of the mighty stream’s eccentricities for\\r\\nthe present--I will give a few more of them further along in the book.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us drop the Mississippi’s physical history, and say a word about its\\r\\nhistorical history--so to speak. We can glance briefly at its slumbrous\\r\\nfirst epoch in a couple of short chapters; at its second and wider-awake\\r\\nepoch in a couple more; at its flushest and widest-awake epoch in a good\\r\\nmany succeeding chapters; and then talk about its comparatively tranquil\\r\\npresent epoch in what shall be left of the book.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world and the books are so accustomed to use, and over-use, the word\\r\\n‘new’ in connection with our country, that we early get and permanently\\r\\nretain the impression that there is nothing old about it. We do of\\r\\ncourse know that there are several comparatively old dates in American\\r\\nhistory, but the mere figures convey to our minds no just idea, no\\r\\ndistinct realization, of the stretch of time which they represent.\\r\\nTo say that De Soto, the first white man who ever saw the Mississippi\\r\\nRiver, saw it in 1542, is a remark which states a fact without\\r\\ninterpreting it: it is something like giving the dimensions of a sunset\\r\\nby astronomical measurements, and cataloguing the colors by their\\r\\nscientific names;--as a result, you get the bald fact of the sunset, but\\r\\nyou don’t see the sunset. It would have been better to paint a picture\\r\\nof it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe date 1542, standing by itself, means little or nothing to us; but\\r\\nwhen one groups a few neighboring historical dates and facts around it,\\r\\nhe adds perspective and color, and then realizes that this is one of the\\r\\nAmerican dates which is quite respectable for age.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, when the Mississippi was first seen by a white man, less\\r\\nthan a quarter of a century had elapsed since Francis I.’s defeat at\\r\\nPavia; the death of Raphael; the death of Bayard, _Sans Peur Et Sans\\r\\nReproche_; the driving out of the Knights-Hospitallers from Rhodes by\\r\\nthe Turks; and the placarding of the Ninety-Five Propositions,--the act\\r\\nwhich began the Reformation. When De Soto took his glimpse of the river,\\r\\nIgnatius Loyola was an obscure name; the order of the Jesuits was not\\r\\nyet a year old; Michael Angelo’s paint was not yet dry on the Last\\r\\nJudgment in the Sistine Chapel; Mary Queen of Scots was not yet born,\\r\\nbut would be before the year closed. Catherine de Medici was a child;\\r\\nElizabeth of England was not yet in her teens; Calvin, Benvenuto\\r\\nCellini, and the Emperor Charles V. were at the top of their fame, and\\r\\neach was manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion; Margaret\\r\\nof Navarre was writing the ‘Heptameron’ and some religious books,--the\\r\\nfirst survives, the others are forgotten, wit and indelicacy being\\r\\nsometimes better literature preservers than holiness; lax court morals\\r\\nand the absurd chivalry business were in full feather, and the joust and\\r\\nthe tournament were the frequent pastime of titled fine gentlemen who\\r\\ncould fight better than they could spell, while religion was the passion\\r\\nof their ladies, and classifying their offspring into children of full\\r\\nrank and children by brevet their pastime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, all around, religion was in a peculiarly blooming condition:\\r\\nthe Council of Trent was being called; the Spanish Inquisition was\\r\\nroasting, and racking, and burning, with a free hand; elsewhere on the\\r\\ncontinent the nations were being persuaded to holy living by the sword\\r\\nand fire; in England, Henry VIII. had suppressed the monasteries,\\r\\nburnt Fisher and another bishop or two, and was getting his English\\r\\nreformation and his harem effectively started. When De Soto stood on the\\r\\nbanks of the Mississippi, it was still two years before Luther’s death;\\r\\neleven years before the burning of Servetus; thirty years before the St.\\r\\nBartholomew slaughter; Rabelais was not yet published; ‘Don Quixote’ was\\r\\nnot yet written; Shakespeare was not yet born; a hundred long years must\\r\\nstill elapse before Englishmen would hear the name of Oliver Cromwell.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnquestionably the discovery of the Mississippi is a datable fact which\\r\\nconsiderably mellows and modifies the shiny newness of our country, and\\r\\ngives her a most respectable outside-aspect of rustiness and antiquity.\\r\\n\\r\\nDe Soto merely glimpsed the river, then died and was buried in it by his\\r\\npriests and soldiers. One would expect the priests and the soldiers\\r\\nto multiply the river’s dimensions by ten--the Spanish custom of the\\r\\nday--and thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it. On\\r\\nthe contrary, their narratives when they reached home, did not excite\\r\\nthat amount of curiosity. The Mississippi was left unvisited by whites\\r\\nduring a term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days. One\\r\\nmay ‘sense’ the interval to his mind, after a fashion, by dividing it\\r\\nup in this way: After De Soto glimpsed the river, a fraction short of\\r\\na quarter of a century elapsed, and then Shakespeare was born; lived a\\r\\ntrifle more than half a century, then died; and when he had been in his\\r\\ngrave considerably more than half a century, the _second _white man saw\\r\\nthe Mississippi. In our day we don’t allow a hundred and thirty years to\\r\\nelapse between glimpses of a marvel. If somebody should discover a creek\\r\\nin the county next to the one that the North Pole is in, Europe and\\r\\nAmerica would start fifteen costly expeditions thither: one to explore\\r\\nthe creek, and the other fourteen to hunt for each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than a hundred and fifty years there had been white settlements\\r\\non our Atlantic coasts. These people were in intimate communication\\r\\nwith the Indians: in the south the Spaniards were robbing, slaughtering,\\r\\nenslaving and converting them; higher up, the English were trading beads\\r\\nand blankets to them for a consideration, and throwing in civilization\\r\\nand whiskey, ‘for lagniappe;’ and in Canada the French were schooling\\r\\nthem in a rudimentary way, missionarying among them, and drawing whole\\r\\npopulations of them at a time to Quebec, and later to Montreal, to buy\\r\\nfurs of them. Necessarily, then, these various clusters of whites must\\r\\nhave heard of the great river of the far west; and indeed, they did\\r\\nhear of it vaguely,--so vaguely and indefinitely, that its course,\\r\\nproportions, and locality were hardly even guessable. The mere\\r\\nmysteriousness of the matter ought to have fired curiosity and compelled\\r\\nexploration; but this did not occur. Apparently nobody happened to want\\r\\nsuch a river, nobody needed it, nobody was curious about it; so, for\\r\\na century and a half the Mississippi remained out of the market and\\r\\nundisturbed. When De Soto found it, he was not hunting for a river, and\\r\\nhad no present occasion for one; consequently he did not value it or\\r\\neven take any particular notice of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last La Salle the Frenchman conceived the idea of seeking out\\r\\nthat river and exploring it. It always happens that when a man seizes\\r\\nupon a neglected and important idea, people inflamed with the same\\r\\nnotion crop up all around. It happened so in this instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally the question suggests itself, Why did these people want the\\r\\nriver now when nobody had wanted it in the five preceding generations?\\r\\nApparently it was because at this late day they thought they had\\r\\ndiscovered a way to make it useful; for it had come to be believed\\r\\nthat the Mississippi emptied into the Gulf of California, and therefore\\r\\nafforded a short cut from Canada to China. Previously the supposition\\r\\nhad been that it emptied into the Atlantic, or Sea of Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe River and Its Explorers\\r\\n\\r\\nLA SALLE himself sued for certain high privileges, and they were\\r\\ngraciously accorded him by Louis XIV of inflated memory. Chief among\\r\\nthem was the privilege to explore, far and wide, and build forts, and\\r\\nstake out continents, and hand the same over to the king, and pay the\\r\\nexpenses himself; receiving, in return, some little advantages of one\\r\\nsort or another; among them the monopoly of buffalo hides. He spent\\r\\nseveral years and about all of his money, in making perilous and painful\\r\\ntrips between Montreal and a fort which he had built on the Illinois,\\r\\nbefore he at last succeeded in getting his expedition in such a shape\\r\\nthat he could strike for the Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd meantime other parties had had better fortune. In 1673 Joliet the\\r\\nmerchant, and Marquette the priest, crossed the country and reached the\\r\\nbanks of the Mississippi. They went by way of the Great Lakes; and from\\r\\nGreen Bay, in canoes, by way of Fox River and the Wisconsin. Marquette\\r\\nhad solemnly contracted, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, that\\r\\nif the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river, he would\\r\\nname it Conception, in her honor. He kept his word. In that day, all\\r\\nexplorers traveled with an outfit of priests. De Soto had twenty-four\\r\\nwith him. La Salle had several, also. The expeditions were often out of\\r\\nmeat, and scant of clothes, but they always had the furniture and other\\r\\nrequisites for the mass; they were always prepared, as one of the quaint\\r\\nchroniclers of the time phrased it, to ‘explain hell to the savages.’\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 17th of June, 1673, the canoes of Joliet and Marquette and\\r\\ntheir five subordinates reached the junction of the Wisconsin with the\\r\\nMississippi. Mr. Parkman says: ‘Before them a wide and rapid current\\r\\ncoursed athwart their way, by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick\\r\\nin forests.’ He continues: ‘Turning southward, they paddled down the\\r\\nstream, through a solitude unrelieved by the faintest trace of man.’\\r\\n\\r\\nA big cat-fish collided with Marquette’s canoe, and startled him; and\\r\\nreasonably enough, for he had been warned by the Indians that he was\\r\\non a foolhardy journey, and even a fatal one, for the river contained\\r\\na demon ‘whose roar could be heard at a great distance, and who would\\r\\nengulf them in the abyss where he dwelt.’ I have seen a Mississippi\\r\\ncat-fish that was more than six feet long, and weighed two hundred and\\r\\nfifty pounds; and if Marquette’s fish was the fellow to that one, he had\\r\\na fair right to think the river’s roaring demon was come.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘At length the buffalo began to appear, grazing in herds on the great\\r\\nprairies which then bordered the river; and Marquette describes the\\r\\nfierce and stupid look of the old bulls as they stared at the intruders\\r\\nthrough the tangled mane which nearly blinded them.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyagers moved cautiously: ‘Landed at night and made a fire to cook\\r\\ntheir evening meal; then extinguished it, embarked again, paddled some\\r\\nway farther, and anchored in the stream, keeping a man on the watch till\\r\\nmorning.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did this day after day and night after night; and at the end of two\\r\\nweeks they had not seen a human being. The river was an awful solitude,\\r\\nthen. And it is now, over most of its stretch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at the close of the fortnight they one day came upon the footprints\\r\\nof men in the mud of the western bank--a Robinson Crusoe experience\\r\\nwhich carries an electric shiver with it yet, when one stumbles on it in\\r\\nprint. They had been warned that the river Indians were as ferocious and\\r\\npitiless as the river demon, and destroyed all comers without waiting\\r\\nfor provocation; but no matter, Joliet and Marquette struck into the\\r\\ncountry to hunt up the proprietors of the tracks. They found them, by\\r\\nand by, and were hospitably received and well treated--if to be received\\r\\nby an Indian chief who has taken off his last rag in order to appear\\r\\nat his level best is to be received hospitably; and if to be treated\\r\\nabundantly to fish, porridge, and other game, including dog, and have\\r\\nthese things forked into one’s mouth by the ungloved fingers of Indians\\r\\nis to be well treated. In the morning the chief and six hundred of his\\r\\ntribesmen escorted the Frenchmen to the river and bade them a friendly\\r\\nfarewell.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the rocks above the present city of Alton they found some rude and\\r\\nfantastic Indian paintings, which they describe. A short distance below\\r\\n‘a torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current\\r\\nof the Mississippi, boiling and surging and sweeping in its course logs,\\r\\nbranches, and uprooted trees.’ This was the mouth of the Missouri, ‘that\\r\\nsavage river,’ which ‘descending from its mad career through a vast\\r\\nunknown of barbarism, poured its turbid floods into the bosom of its\\r\\ngentle sister.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by they passed the mouth of the Ohio; they passed cane-brakes;\\r\\nthey fought mosquitoes; they floated along, day after day, through the\\r\\ndeep silence and loneliness of the river, drowsing in the scant shade\\r\\nof makeshift awnings, and broiling with the heat; they encountered and\\r\\nexchanged civilities with another party of Indians; and at last\\r\\nthey reached the mouth of the Arkansas (about a month out from their\\r\\nstarting-point), where a tribe of war-whooping savages swarmed out to\\r\\nmeet and murder them; but they appealed to the Virgin for help; so in\\r\\nplace of a fight there was a feast, and plenty of pleasant palaver and\\r\\nfol-de-rol.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had proved to their satisfaction, that the Mississippi did not\\r\\nempty into the Gulf of California, or into the Atlantic. They believed\\r\\nit emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. They turned back, now, and carried\\r\\ntheir great news to Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut belief is not proof. It was reserved for La Salle to furnish the\\r\\nproof. He was provokingly delayed, by one misfortune after another, but\\r\\nat last got his expedition under way at the end of the year 1681. In the\\r\\ndead of winter he and Henri de Tonty, son of Lorenzo Tonty, who invented\\r\\nthe tontine, his lieutenant, started down the Illinois, with a\\r\\nfollowing of eighteen Indians brought from New England, and twenty-three\\r\\nFrenchmen. They moved in procession down the surface of the frozen\\r\\nriver, on foot, and dragging their canoes after them on sledges.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Peoria Lake they struck open water, and paddled thence to the\\r\\nMississippi and turned their prows southward. They plowed through the\\r\\nfields of floating ice, past the mouth of the Missouri; past the mouth\\r\\nof the Ohio, by-and-by; ‘and, gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp,\\r\\nlanded on the 24th of February near the Third Chickasaw Bluffs,’ where\\r\\nthey halted and built Fort Prudhomme.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Again,’ says Mr. Parkman, ‘they embarked; and with every stage of their\\r\\nadventurous progress, the mystery of this vast new world was more and\\r\\nmore unveiled. More and more they entered the realms of spring. The\\r\\nhazy sunlight, the warm and drowsy air, the tender foliage, the opening\\r\\nflowers, betokened the reviving life of nature.’\\r\\n\\r\\nDay by day they floated down the great bends, in the shadow of the dense\\r\\nforests, and in time arrived at the mouth of the Arkansas. First, they\\r\\nwere greeted by the natives of this locality as Marquette had before\\r\\nbeen greeted by them--with the booming of the war drum and the flourish\\r\\nof arms. The Virgin composed the difficulty in Marquette’s case; the\\r\\npipe of peace did the same office for La Salle. The white man and the\\r\\nred man struck hands and entertained each other during three days. Then,\\r\\nto the admiration of the savages, La Salle set up a cross with the\\r\\narms of France on it, and took possession of the whole country for the\\r\\nking--the cool fashion of the time--while the priest piously consecrated\\r\\nthe robbery with a hymn. The priest explained the mysteries of the faith\\r\\n‘by signs,’ for the saving of the savages; thus compensating them with\\r\\npossible possessions in Heaven for the certain ones on earth which they\\r\\nhad just been robbed of. And also, by signs, La Salle drew from these\\r\\nsimple children of the forest acknowledgments of fealty to Louis the\\r\\nPutrid, over the water. Nobody smiled at these colossal ironies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese performances took place on the site of the future town of\\r\\nNapoleon, Arkansas, and there the first confiscation-cross was raised\\r\\non the banks of the great river. Marquette’s and Joliet’s voyage\\r\\nof discovery ended at the same spot--the site of the future town of\\r\\nNapoleon. When De Soto took his fleeting glimpse of the river, away back\\r\\nin the dim early days, he took it from that same spot--the site of the\\r\\nfuture town of Napoleon, Arkansas. Therefore, three out of the four\\r\\nmemorable events connected with the discovery and exploration of the\\r\\nmighty river, occurred, by accident, in one and the same place. It is a\\r\\nmost curious distinction, when one comes to look at it and think about\\r\\nit. France stole that vast country on that spot, the future Napoleon;\\r\\nand by and by Napoleon himself was to give the country back again!--make\\r\\nrestitution, not to the owners, but to their white American heirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyagers journeyed on, touching here and there; ‘passed the sites,\\r\\nsince become historic, of Vicksburg and Grand Gulf,’ and visited an\\r\\nimposing Indian monarch in the Teche country, whose capital city was a\\r\\nsubstantial one of sun-baked bricks mixed with straw--better houses than\\r\\nmany that exist there now. The chiefs house contained an audience room\\r\\nforty feet square; and there he received Tonty in State, surrounded by\\r\\nsixty old men clothed in white cloaks. There was a temple in the town,\\r\\nwith a mud wall about it ornamented with skulls of enemies sacrificed to\\r\\nthe sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voyagers visited the Natchez Indians, near the site of the\\r\\npresent city of that name, where they found a ‘religious and political\\r\\ndespotism, a privileged class descended from the sun, a temple and a\\r\\nsacred fire.’ It must have been like getting home again; it was home\\r\\nwith an advantage, in fact, for it lacked Louis XIV.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few more days swept swiftly by, and La Salle stood in the shadow of\\r\\nhis confiscating cross, at the meeting of the waters from Delaware, and\\r\\nfrom Itaska, and from the mountain ranges close upon the Pacific,\\r\\nwith the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, his task finished, his prodigy\\r\\nachieved. Mr. Parkman, in closing his fascinating narrative, thus sums\\r\\nup:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘On that day, the realm of France received on parchment a stupendous\\r\\naccession. The fertile plains of Texas; the vast basin of the\\r\\nMississippi, from its frozen northern springs to the sultry borders of\\r\\nthe Gulf; from the woody ridges of the Alleghanies to the bare peaks\\r\\nof the Rocky Mountains--a region of savannas and forests, sun-cracked\\r\\ndeserts and grassy prairies, watered by a thousand rivers, ranged by\\r\\na thousand warlike tribes, passed beneath the scepter of the Sultan of\\r\\nVersailles; and all by virtue of a feeble human voice, inaudible at half\\r\\na mile.’\\r\\n\\r\\n'),\n",

       "  \"\\ufeffThe American's Claimant\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a matchless morning in rural England. On a fair hill we see a\\r\\nmajestic pile, the ivied walls and towers of Cholmondeley Castle, huge\\r\\nrelic and witness of the baronial grandeurs of the Middle Ages. This is\\r\\none of the seats of the Earl of Rossmore, K. G. G. C. B. K. C. M. G.,\\r\\netc., etc., etc., etc., etc., who possesses twenty-two thousand acres\\r\\nof English land, owns a parish in London with two thousand houses on its\\r\\nlease-roll, and struggles comfortably along on an income of two hundred\\r\\nthousand pounds a year. The father and founder of this proud old line\\r\\nwas William the Conqueror his very self; the mother of it was not\\r\\ninventoried in history by name, she being merely a random episode and\\r\\ninconsequential, like the tanner’s daughter of Falaise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a breakfast room of the castle on this breezy fine morning there are\\r\\ntwo persons and the cooling remains of a deserted meal. One of these\\r\\npersons is the old lord, tall, erect, square-shouldered, white-haired,\\r\\nstern-browed, a man who shows character in every feature, attitude,\\r\\nand movement, and carries his seventy years as easily as most men carry\\r\\nfifty. The other person is his only son and heir, a dreamy-eyed young\\r\\nfellow, who looks about twenty-six but is nearer thirty. Candor,\\r\\nkindliness, honesty, sincerity, simplicity, modesty--it is easy to see\\r\\nthat these are cardinal traits of his character; and so when you have\\r\\nclothed him in the formidable components of his name, you somehow\\r\\nseem to be contemplating a lamb in armor: his name and style being\\r\\nthe Honourable Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers\\r\\nViscount-Berkeley, of Cholmondeley Castle, Warwickshire. (Pronounced\\r\\nK’koobry Thlanover Marshbanks Sellers Vycount Barkly, of Chumly Castle,\\r\\nWarrikshr.) He is standing by a great window, in an attitude suggestive\\r\\nof respectful attention to what his father is saying and equally\\r\\nrespectful dissent from the positions and arguments offered. The father\\r\\nwalks the floor as he talks, and his talk shows that his temper is away\\r\\nup toward summer heat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Soft-spirited as you are, Berkeley, I am quite aware that when you\\r\\nhave once made up your mind to do a thing which your ideas of honor and\\r\\njustice require you to do, argument and reason are (for the time being,)\\r\\nwasted upon you--yes, and ridicule; persuasion, supplication, and\\r\\ncommand as well. To my mind--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father, if you will look at it without prejudice, without passion, you\\r\\nmust concede that I am not doing a rash thing, a thoughtless, wilful\\r\\nthing, with nothing substantial behind it to justify it. I did not\\r\\ncreate the American claimant to the earldom of Rossmore; I did not hunt\\r\\nfor him, did not find him, did not obtrude him upon your notice. He\\r\\nfound himself, he injected himself into our lives--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And has made mine a purgatory for ten years with his tiresome letters,\\r\\nhis wordy reasonings, his acres of tedious evidence,--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which you would never read, would never consent to read. Yet in common\\r\\nfairness he was entitled to a hearing. That hearing would either prove\\r\\nhe was the rightful earl--in which case our course would be plain--or\\r\\nit would prove that he wasn’t--in which case our course would be equally\\r\\nplain. I have read his evidences, my lord. I have conned them well,\\r\\nstudied them patiently and thoroughly. The chain seems to be complete,\\r\\nno important link wanting. I believe he is the rightful earl.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I a usurper--a--nameless pauper, a tramp! Consider what you are\\r\\nsaying, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Father, if he is the rightful earl, would you, could you--that fact\\r\\nbeing established--consent to keep his titles and his properties from\\r\\nhim a day, an hour, a minute?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are talking nonsense--nonsense--lurid idiocy! Now, listen to me. I\\r\\nwill make a confession--if you wish to call it by that name. I did not\\r\\nread those evidences because I had no occasion to--I was made familiar\\r\\nwith them in the time of this claimant’s father and of my own father\\r\\nforty years ago. This fellow’s predecessors have kept mine more or less\\r\\nfamiliar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty years. The truth\\r\\nis, the rightful heir did go to America, with the Fairfax heir or about\\r\\nthe same time--but disappeared--somewhere in the wilds of Virginia, got\\r\\nmarried, and began to breed savages for the Claimant market; wrote no\\r\\nletters home; was supposed to be dead; his younger brother softly took\\r\\npossession; presently the American did die, and straightway his eldest\\r\\nproduct put in his claim--by letter--letter still in existence--and\\r\\ndied before the uncle in-possession found time--or maybe\\r\\ninclination--to--answer. The infant son of that eldest product\\r\\ngrew up--long interval, you see--and he took to writing letters and\\r\\nfurnishing evidences. Well, successor after successor has done the same,\\r\\ndown to the present idiot. It was a succession of paupers; not one of\\r\\nthem was ever able to pay his passage to England or institute suit. The\\r\\nFairfaxes kept their lordship alive, and so they have never lost it to\\r\\nthis day, although they live in Maryland; their friend lost his by his\\r\\nown neglect. You perceive now, that the facts in this case bring us to\\r\\nprecisely this result: morally the American tramp is rightful earl of\\r\\nRossmore; legally he has no more right than his dog. There now--are you\\r\\nsatisfied?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a pause, then the son glanced at the crest carved in the great\\r\\noaken mantel and said, with a regretful note in his voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Since the introduction of heraldic symbols,--the motto of this house\\r\\nhas been ‘Suum cuique’--to every man his own. By your own intrepidly\\r\\nfrank confession, my lord, it is become a sarcasm: If Simon Lathers--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep that exasperating name to yourself! For ten years it has pestered\\r\\nmy eye--and tortured my ear; till at last my very footfalls time\\r\\nthemselves to the brain-racking rhythm of Simon Lathers!--Simon Lathers!\\r\\n--Simon Lathers! And now, to make its presence in my soul eternal,\\r\\nimmortal, imperishable, you have resolved to--to--what is it you have\\r\\nresolved to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To go to Simon Lathers, in America, and change places with him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What? Deliver the reversion of the earldom into his hands?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is my purpose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Make this tremendous surrender without even trying the fantastic case\\r\\nin the Lords?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ye--s--” with hesitation and some embarrassment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By all that is amazing, I believe you are insane, my son. See here\\r\\n--have you been training with that ass again--that radical, if you\\r\\nprefer the term, though the words are synonymous--Lord Tanzy, of\\r\\nTollmache?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe son did not reply, and the old lord continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you confess. That puppy, that shame to his birth and caste, who\\r\\nholds all hereditary lordships and privilege to be usurpation, all\\r\\nnobility a tinsel sham, all aristocratic institutions a fraud, all\\r\\ninequalities in rank a legalized crime and an infamy, and no bread\\r\\nhonest bread that a man doesn’t earn by his own work--work, pah!”--and\\r\\nthe old patrician brushed imaginary labor-dirt from his white hands.\\r\\n“You have come to hold just those opinions yourself, I suppose,”--he added\\r\\nwith a sneer.\\r\\n\\r\\nA faint flush in the younger man’s cheek told that the shot had hit and\\r\\nhurt; but he answered with dignity:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have. I say it without shame--I feel none. And now my reason for\\r\\nresolving to renounce my heirship without resistance is explained. I\\r\\nwish to retire from what to me is a false existence, a false position,\\r\\nand begin my life over again--begin it right--begin it on the level of\\r\\nmere manhood, unassisted by factitious aids, and succeed or fail by pure\\r\\nmerit or the want of it. I will go to America, where all men are equal\\r\\nand all have an equal chance; I will live or die, sink or swim, win or\\r\\nlose as just a man--that alone, and not a single helping gaud or fiction\\r\\nback of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hear, hear!” The two men looked each other steadily in the eye a\\r\\nmoment or two, then the elder one added, musingly, “Ab-so-lutely\\r\\ncra-zy--ab-solutely!” After another silence, he said, as one who, long\\r\\ntroubled by clouds, detects a ray of sunshine, “Well, there will be one\\r\\nsatisfaction--Simon Lathers will come here to enter into his own, and I\\r\\nwill drown him in the horsepond. The poor devil--always so humble in\\r\\nhis letters, so pitiful, so deferential; so steeped in reverence for our\\r\\ngreat line and lofty-station; so anxious to placate us, so prayerful\\r\\nfor recognition as a relative, a bearer in his veins of our sacred\\r\\nblood--and withal so poor, so needy, so threadbare and pauper-shod as\\r\\nto raiment, so despised, so laughed at for his silly claimantship by the\\r\\nlewd American scum around him--ah, the vulgar, crawling, insufferable\\r\\ntramp! To read one of his cringing, nauseating letters--well?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis to a splendid flunkey, all in inflamed plush and buttons and\\r\\nknee-breeches as to his trunk, and a glinting white frost-work of\\r\\nground-glass paste as to his head, who stood with his heels together and\\r\\nthe upper half of him bent forward, a salver in his hands:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The letters, my lord.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy lord took them, and the servant disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Among the rest, an American letter. From the tramp, of course. Jove,\\r\\nbut here’s a change! No brown paper envelope this time, filched from\\r\\na shop, and carrying the shop’s advertisement in the corner. Oh, no,\\r\\na proper enough envelope--with a most ostentatiously broad mourning\\r\\nborder--for his cat, perhaps, since he was a bachelor--and fastened with\\r\\nred wax--a batch of it as big as a half-crown--and--and--our crest for\\r\\na seal!--motto and all. And the ignorant, sprawling hand is gone; he\\r\\nsports a secretary, evidently--a secretary with a most confident swing\\r\\nand flourish to his pen. Oh indeed, our fortunes are improving over\\r\\nthere--our meek tramp has undergone a metamorphosis.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Read it, my lord, please.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, this time I will.

Why, Berkeley, his breezy\\r\\nimpudence is--is--why, it’s colossal, it’s sublime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, this one doesn’t seem to cringe much.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cringe--why, he doesn’t know the meaning of the word. Hatchments! To\\r\\ncommemorate that sniveling tramp and his, fraternal duplicate. And he is\\r\\ngoing to send me the remains. The late Claimant was a fool, but plainly\\r\\nthis new one’s a maniac. What a name! Mulberry Sellers--there’s music\\r\\nfor you, Simon Lathers--Mulberry Sellers--Mulberry Sellers--Simon\\r\\nLathers. Sounds like machinery working and churning. Simon Lathers,\\r\\nMulberry Sel--Are you going?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I have your leave, father.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old gentleman stood musing some time, after his son was gone. This\\r\\nwas his thought:\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is a good boy, and lovable. Let him take his own course--as it would\\r\\nprofit nothing to oppose him--make things worse, in fact. My arguments\\r\\nand his aunt’s persuasions have failed; let us see what America can\\r\\ndo for us. Let us see what equality and hard-times can effect for the\\r\\nmental health of a brain-sick young British lord. Going to renounce his\\r\\nlordship and be a man! Yas!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOLONEL MULBERRY SELLERS--this was some days before he wrote his letter\\r\\nto Lord Rossmore--was seated in his “library,” which was also his\\r\\n“drawing-room” and was also his “picture gallery” and likewise his\\r\\n“work-shop.” Sometimes he called it by one of these names, sometimes\\r\\nby another, according to occasion and circumstance. He was constructing\\r\\nwhat seemed to be some kind of a frail mechanical toy; and was\\r\\napparently very much interested in his work. He was a white-headed\\r\\nman, now, but otherwise he was as young, alert, buoyant, visionary\\r\\nand enterprising as ever. His loving old wife sat near by, contentedly\\r\\nknitting and thinking, with a cat asleep in her lap. The room was large,\\r\\nlight, and had a comfortable look, in fact a home-like look, though\\r\\nthe furniture was of a humble sort and not over abundant, and the\\r\\nknickknacks and things that go to adorn a living-room not plenty and not\\r\\ncostly. But there were natural flowers, and there was an abstract and\\r\\nunclassifiable something about the place which betrayed the presence in\\r\\nthe house of somebody with a happy taste and an effective touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the deadly chromos on the walls were somehow without offence; in\\r\\nfact they seemed to belong there and to add an attraction to the room--a\\r\\nfascination, anyway; for whoever got his eye on one of them was like to\\r\\ngaze and suffer till he died--you have seen that kind of pictures.\\r\\nSome of these terrors were landscapes, some libeled the sea, some\\r\\nwere ostensible portraits, all were crimes. All the portraits were\\r\\nrecognizable as dead Americans of distinction, and yet, through labeling\\r\\nadded, by a daring hand, they were all doing duty here as “Earls of\\r\\nRossmore.” The newest one had left the works as Andrew Jackson, but was\\r\\ndoing its best now, as “Simon Lathers Lord Rossmore, Present Earl.” On\\r\\none wall was a cheap old railroad map of Warwickshire. This had been\\r\\nnewly labeled “The Rossmore Estates.” On the opposite wall was another\\r\\nmap, and this was the most imposing decoration of the establishment and\\r\\nthe first to catch a stranger’s attention, because of its great size. It\\r\\nhad once borne simply the title SIBERIA; but now the word “FUTURE” had\\r\\nbeen written in front of that word. There were other additions, in red\\r\\nink--many cities, with great populations set down, scattered over\\r\\nthe vast-country at points where neither cities nor populations exist\\r\\nto-day. One of these cities, with population placed at 1,500,000,\\r\\nbore the name “Libertyorloffskoizalinski,” and there was a still more\\r\\npopulous one, centrally located and marked “Capital,” which bore the\\r\\nname “Freedomolovnaivanovich.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “mansion”--the Colonel’s usual name for the house--was a rickety old\\r\\ntwo-story frame of considerable size, which had been painted, some time\\r\\nor other, but had nearly forgotten it. It was away out in the ragged\\r\\nedge of Washington and had once been somebody’s country place. It had\\r\\na neglected yard around it, with paling fence that needed straightening\\r\\nup, in places, and a gate that would stay shut. By the door-post were\\r\\nseveral modest tin signs. “Col. Mulberry Sellers, Attorney at Law and\\r\\nClaim Agent,” was the principal one. One learned from the others that\\r\\nthe Colonel was a Materializer, a Hypnotizer, a Mind-Cure dabbler; and\\r\\nso on. For he was a man who could always find things to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nA white-headed negro man, with spectacles and damaged white cotton\\r\\ngloves appeared in the presence, made a stately obeisance and announced:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Marse Washington Hawkins, suh.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Great Scott! Show him in, Dan’l, show him in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel and his wife were on their feet in a moment, and the\\r\\nnext moment were joyfully wringing the hands of a stoutish,\\r\\ndiscouraged-looking man whose general aspect suggested that he was fifty\\r\\nyears old, but whose hair swore to a hundred.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, well, Washington, my boy, it is good to look at you again.\\r\\nSit down, sit down, and make yourself at home. There, now--why, you look\\r\\nperfectly natural; aging a little, just a little, but you’d have known\\r\\nhim anywhere, wouldn’t you, Polly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, Berry, he’s just like his pa would have looked if he’d lived.\\r\\nDear, dear, where have you dropped from? Let me see, how long is it\\r\\nsince--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should say it’s all of fifteen years, Mrs. Sellers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, how time does get away with us. Yes, and oh, the changes\\r\\nthat--”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a sudden catch of her voice and a trembling of the lip, the\\r\\nmen waiting reverently for her to get command of herself and go on; but\\r\\nafter a little struggle she turned away, with her apron to her eyes, and\\r\\nsoftly disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seeing you made her think of the children, poor thing--dear, dear,\\r\\nthey’re all dead but the youngest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But banish care, it’s no time for it now--on with the dance, let joy be\\r\\nunconfined is my motto, whether there’s any dance to dance; or any joy\\r\\nto unconfine--you’ll be the healthier for it every time,--every time,\\r\\nWashington--it’s my experience, and I’ve seen a good deal of this world.\\r\\nCome--where have you disappeared to all these years, and are you from\\r\\nthere, now, or where are you from?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t quite think you would ever guess, Colonel. Cherokee Strip.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My land!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure as you live.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t mean it. Actually living out there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, yes, if a body may call it that; though it’s a pretty strong\\r\\nterm for ‘dobies and jackass rabbits, boiled beans and slap-jacks,\\r\\ndepression, withered hopes, poverty in all its varieties--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Louise out there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and the children.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Out there now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I couldn’t afford to bring them with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I see,--you had to come--claim against the government. Make\\r\\nyourself perfectly easy--I’ll take care of that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it isn’t a claim against the government.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No? Want to be postmaster? That’s all right. Leave it to me. I’ll fix\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it isn’t postmaster--you’re all astray yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, good gracious, Washington, why don’t you come out and tell me\\r\\nwhat it is? What, do you want to be so reserved and distrustful with an\\r\\nold friend like me for? Don’t you reckon I can keep a se--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s no secret about it--you merely don’t give me a chance to--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now look here, old friend, I know the human race; and I know that when\\r\\na man comes to Washington, I don’t care if it’s from heaven, let alone\\r\\nCherokee-Strip, it’s because he wants something. And I know that as\\r\\na rule he’s not going to get it; that he’ll stay and try--for another\\r\\nthing and won’t get that; the same luck with the next and the next\\r\\nand the next; and keeps on till he strikes bottom, and is too poor\\r\\nand ashamed to go back, even to Cherokee Strip; and at last his heart\\r\\nbreaks--and they take up a collection and bury him. There--don’t\\r\\ninterrupt me, I know what I’m talking about. Happy and prosperous in the\\r\\nFar West wasn’t I? You know that. Principal citizen of Hawkeye, looked\\r\\nup to by everybody, kind of an autocrat, actually a kind of an autocrat,\\r\\nWashington. Well, nothing would do but I must go Minister to St.\\r\\nJames, the Governor and everybody insisting, you know, and so at last I\\r\\nconsented--no getting out of it, had to do it, so here I came. A day too\\r\\nlate, Washington. Think of that--what little things change the world’s\\r\\nhistory--yes, sir, the place had been filled. Well, there I was, you\\r\\nsee. I offered to compromise and go to Paris. The President was very\\r\\nsorry and all that, but that place, you see, didn’t belong to the West,\\r\\nso there I was again. There was no help for it, so I had to stoop a\\r\\nlittle--we all reach the day some time or other when we’ve got to do\\r\\nthat, Washington, and it’s not a bad thing for us, either, take it by\\r\\nand large and all around--I had to stoop a little and offer to\\r\\ntake Constantinople. Washington, consider this--for it’s perfectly\\r\\ntrue--within a month I asked for China; within another month I begged\\r\\nfor Japan; one year later I was away down, down, down, supplicating with\\r\\ntears and anguish for the bottom office in the gift of the government\\r\\nof the United States--Flint-Picker in the cellars of the War Department.\\r\\nAnd by George I didn’t get it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Flint-Picker?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Office established in the time of the Revolution, last century.\\r\\nThe musket-flints for the military posts were supplied from the capitol.\\r\\nThey do it yet; for although the flint-arm has gone out and the forts\\r\\nhave tumbled down, the decree hasn’t been repealed--been overlooked\\r\\nand forgotten, you see--and so the vacancies where old Ticonderoga and\\r\\nothers used to stand, still get their six quarts of gun-flints a year\\r\\njust the same.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington said musingly after a pause:\\r\\n\\r\\n“How strange it seems--to start for Minister to England at twenty\\r\\nthousand a year and fail for flintpicker at--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three dollars a week. It’s human life, Washington--just an epitome of\\r\\nhuman ambition, and struggle, and the outcome: you aim for the palace\\r\\nand get drowned in the sewer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was another meditative silence. Then Washington said, with earnest\\r\\ncompassion in his voice--\\r\\n\\r\\n“And so, after coming here, against your inclination, to satisfy your\\r\\nsense of patriotic duty and appease a selfish public clamor, you get\\r\\nabsolutely nothing for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing?” The Colonel had to get up and stand, to get room for his\\r\\namazement to expand. “Nothing, Washington? I ask you this: to be a\\r\\nperpetual Member and the only Perpetual Member of a Diplomatic Body\\r\\naccredited to the greatest country on earth do you call that nothing?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Washington’s turn to be amazed. He was stricken dumb; but the\\r\\nwide-eyed wonder, the reverent admiration expressed in his face were\\r\\nmore eloquent than any words could have been. The Colonel’s wounded\\r\\nspirit was healed and he resumed his seat pleased and content. He leaned\\r\\nforward and said impressively:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What was due to a man who had become forever conspicuous by an\\r\\nexperience without precedent in the history of the world?--a man made\\r\\npermanently and diplomatically sacred, so to speak, by having been\\r\\nconnected, temporarily, through solicitation, with every single\\r\\ndiplomatic post in the roster of this government, from Envoy\\r\\nExtraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James all\\r\\nthe way down to Consul to a guano rock in the Strait of Sunda--salary\\r\\npayable in guano--which disappeared by volcanic convulsion the day\\r\\nbefore they got down to my name in the list of applicants. Certainly\\r\\nsomething august enough to be answerable to the size of this unique and\\r\\nmemorable experience was my due, and I got it. By the common voice of\\r\\nthis community, by acclamation of the people, that mighty utterance\\r\\nwhich brushes aside laws and legislation, and from whose decrees there\\r\\nis no appeal, I was named Perpetual Member of the Diplomatic Body\\r\\nrepresenting the multifarious sovereignties and civilizations of the\\r\\nglobe near the republican court of the United States of America. And\\r\\nthey brought me home with a torchlight procession.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is wonderful, Colonel, simply wonderful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the loftiest official position in the whole earth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should think so--and the most commanding.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have named the word. Think of it. I frown, and there is war; I\\r\\nsmile, and contending nations lay down their arms.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is awful. The responsibility, I mean.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is nothing. Responsibility is no burden to me; I am used to it; have\\r\\nalways been used to it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the work--the work! Do you have to attend all the sittings?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who, I? Does the Emperor of Russia attend the conclaves of the\\r\\ngovernors of the provinces? He sits at home, and indicates his\\r\\npleasure.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington was silent a moment, then a deep sigh escaped him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How proud I was an hour ago; how paltry seems my little promotion\\r\\nnow! Colonel, the reason I came to Washington is,--I am Congressional\\r\\nDelegate from Cherokee Strip!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel sprang to his feet and broke out with prodigious enthusiasm:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me your hand, my boy--this is immense news! I congratulate you\\r\\nwith all my heart. My prophecies stand confirmed. I always said it\\r\\nwas in you. I always said you were born for high distinction and would\\r\\nachieve it. You ask Polly if I didn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington was dazed by this most unexpected demonstration.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Colonel, there’s nothing to it. That little narrow, desolate,\\r\\nunpeopled, oblong streak of grass and gravel, lost in the remote wastes\\r\\nof the vast continent--why, it’s like representing a billiard table--a\\r\\ndiscarded one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tut-tut, it’s a great, it’s a staving preferment, and just opulent with\\r\\ninfluence here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shucks, Colonel, I haven’t even a vote.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s nothing; you can make speeches.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I can’t. The population’s only two hundred--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all right, that’s all right--”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And they hadn’t any right to elect me; we’re not even a territory,\\r\\nthere’s no Organic Act, the government hasn’t any official knowledge of\\r\\nus whatever.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind about that; I’ll fix that. I’ll rush the thing through, I’ll\\r\\nget you organized in no time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you, Colonel?--it’s too good of you; but it’s just your old\\r\\nsterling self, the same old ever-faithful friend,” and the grateful\\r\\ntears welled up in Washington’s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s just as good as done, my boy, just as good as done. Shake hands.\\r\\nWe’ll hitch teams together, you and I, and we’ll make things hum!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"),\n",

       "  '\\ufeffThe Gilded Age, -and Charles Dudley Warner\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\n\\r\\nJune 18--. Squire Hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks, called\\r\\nthe “stile,” in front of his house, contemplating the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe locality was Obedstown, East Tennessee. You would not know that\\r\\nObedstown stood on the top of a mountain, for there was nothing about\\r\\nthe landscape to indicate it--but it did: a mountain that stretched\\r\\nabroad over whole counties, and rose very gradually. The district\\r\\nwas called the “Knobs of East Tennessee,” and had a reputation like\\r\\nNazareth, as far as turning out any good thing was concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Squire’s house was a double log cabin, in a state of decay; two\\r\\nor three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold, and lifted their\\r\\nheads sadly whenever Mrs. Hawkins or the children stepped in and out\\r\\nover their bodies. Rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard; a\\r\\nbench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of\\r\\nwater and a gourd; a cat had begun to drink from the pail, but the\\r\\nexertion was overtaxing her energies, and she had stopped to rest. There\\r\\nwas an ash-hopper by the fence, and an iron pot, for soft-soap-boiling,\\r\\nnear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dwelling constituted one-fifteenth of Obedstown; the other fourteen\\r\\nhouses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the\\r\\ncorn-fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the\\r\\ncity and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on\\r\\nhis eyes for information.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Squire” Hawkins got his title from being postmaster of Obedstown--not\\r\\nthat the title properly belonged to the office, but because in those\\r\\nregions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort, and so\\r\\nthe usual courtesy had been extended to Hawkins. The mail was monthly,\\r\\nand sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single\\r\\ndelivery. Even a rush like this did not fill up the postmaster’s whole\\r\\nmonth, though, and therefore he “kept store” in the intervals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Squire was contemplating the morning. It was balmy and tranquil, the\\r\\nvagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers, the murmur of bees\\r\\nwas in the air, there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that\\r\\nsummer woodlands bring to the senses, and the vague, pleasurable\\r\\nmelancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the United States mail arrived, on horseback. There was but\\r\\none letter, and it was for the postmaster. The long-legged youth who\\r\\ncarried the mail tarried an hour to talk, for there was no hurry; and in\\r\\na little while the male population of the village had assembled to\\r\\nhelp. As a general thing, they were dressed in homespun “jeans,” blue or\\r\\nyellow--here were no other varieties of it; all wore one suspender and\\r\\nsometimes two--yarn ones knitted at home,--some wore vests, but few\\r\\nwore coats. Such coats and vests as did appear, however, were rather\\r\\npicturesque than otherwise, for they were made of tolerably fanciful\\r\\npatterns of calico--a fashion which prevails thereto this day among\\r\\nthose of the community who have tastes above the common level and are\\r\\nable to afford style. Every individual arrived with his hands in his\\r\\npockets; a hand came out occasionally for a purpose, but it always went\\r\\nback again after service; and if it was the head that was served, just\\r\\nthe cant that the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted\\r\\nunder, was retained until the next call altered the inclination; many\\r\\nhats were present, but none were erect and no two were canted just\\r\\nalike. We are speaking impartially of men, youths and boys. And we are\\r\\nalso speaking of these three estates when we say that every individual\\r\\nwas either chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises, or\\r\\nsmoking the same in a corn-cob pipe. Few of the men wore whiskers; none\\r\\nwore moustaches; some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and\\r\\nhiding the throat--the only pattern recognized there as being the\\r\\ncorrect thing in whiskers; but no part of any individual’s face had seen\\r\\na razor for a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier\\r\\nreflectively while he talked; but fatigue soon began to show itself,\\r\\nand one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the\\r\\nfence, hump-shouldered and grave, like a company of buzzards assembled\\r\\nfor supper and listening for the death-rattle. Old Damrell said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tha hain’t no news ‘bout the jedge, hit ain’t likely?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cain’t tell for sartin; some thinks he’s gwyne to be ‘long toreckly,\\r\\nand some thinks ‘e hain’t. Russ Mosely he tote ole Hanks he mought git\\r\\nto Obeds tomorrer or nex’ day he reckoned.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I wisht I knowed. I got a ‘prime sow and pigs in the cote-house,\\r\\nand I hain’t got no place for to put ‘em. If the jedge is a gwyne to\\r\\nhold cote, I got to roust ‘em out, I reckon. But tomorrer’ll do, I\\r\\n‘spect.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stem-end of a\\r\\ntomato and shot a bumble-bee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet\\r\\naway. One after another the several chewers expressed a charge of\\r\\ntobacco juice and delivered it at the deceased with steady, aim and\\r\\nfaultless accuracy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s a stirrin’, down ‘bout the Forks?” continued Old Damrell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I dunno, skasely. Ole Drake Higgins he’s ben down to Shelby\\r\\nlas’ week. Tuck his crap down; couldn’t git shet o’ the most uv it; hit\\r\\nwasn’t no time for to sell, he say, so he ‘fotch it back agin, ‘lowin’\\r\\nto wait tell fall. Talks ‘bout goin’ to Mozouri--lots uv ‘ems talkin’\\r\\nthat--away down thar, Ole Higgins say. Cain’t make a livin’ here no mo’,\\r\\nsich times as these. Si Higgins he’s ben over to Kaintuck n’ married a\\r\\nhigh-toned gal thar, outen the fust families, an’ he’s come back to the\\r\\nForks with jist a hell’s-mint o’ whoop-jamboree notions, folks says.\\r\\nHe’s tuck an’ fixed up the ole house like they does in Kaintuck, he say,\\r\\nan’ tha’s ben folks come cler from Turpentine for to see it. He’s tuck\\r\\nan gawmed it all over on the inside with plarsterin’.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s plasterin’?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dono. Hit’s what he calls it. Ole Mam Higgins, she tole me. She say\\r\\nshe wasn’t gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog. Says\\r\\nit’s mud, or some sich kind o’ nastiness that sticks on n’ covers up\\r\\neverything. Plarsterin’, Si calls it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis marvel was discussed at considerable length; and almost with\\r\\nanimation. But presently there was a dog-fight over in the neighborhood\\r\\nof the blacksmith shop, and the visitors slid off their perch like so\\r\\nmany turtles and strode to the battle-field with an interest bordering\\r\\non eagerness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Squire remained, and read his letter. Then he sighed, and sat long\\r\\nin meditation. At intervals he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Missouri. Missouri. Well, well, well, everything is so uncertain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe I’ll do it.--A man will just rot, here. My house my yard,\\r\\neverything around me, in fact, shows’ that I am becoming one of these\\r\\ncattle--and I used to be thrifty in other times.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not more than thirty-five, but he had a worn look that made him\\r\\nseem older. He left the stile, entered that part of his house which was\\r\\nthe store, traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of\\r\\nbeeswax, to an old dame in linsey-woolsey, put his letter away, and\\r\\nwent into the kitchen. His wife was there, constructing some dried apple\\r\\npies; a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weather-vane of\\r\\nhis own contriving; his small sister, close upon four years of age, was\\r\\nsopping corn-bread in some gravy left in the bottom of a frying-pan and\\r\\ntrying hard not to sop over a finger-mark that divided the pan through\\r\\nthe middle--for the other side belonged to the brother, whose musings\\r\\nmade him forget his stomach for the moment; a negro woman was busy\\r\\ncooking, at a vast fire-place. Shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nancy, I’ve made up my mind. The world is done with me, and perhaps\\r\\nI ought to be done with it. But no matter--I can wait. I am going to\\r\\nMissouri. I won’t stay in this dead country and decay with it. I’ve had\\r\\nit on my mind sometime. I’m going to sell out here for whatever I can\\r\\nget, and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and\\r\\nstart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anywhere that suits you, suits me, Si. And the children can’t be any\\r\\nworse off in Missouri than, they are here, I reckon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMotioning his wife to a private conference in their own room, Hawkins\\r\\nsaid: “No, they’ll be better off. I’ve looked out for them, Nancy,” and\\r\\nhis face lighted. “Do you see these papers? Well, they are evidence\\r\\nthat I have taken up Seventy-five Thousand Acres of Land in this\\r\\ncounty--think what an enormous fortune it will be some day! Why, Nancy,\\r\\nenormous don’t express it--the word’s too tame! I tell your Nancy----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For goodness sake, Si----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait, Nancy, wait--let me finish--I’ve been secretly bailing and fuming\\r\\nwith this grand inspiration for weeks, and I must talk or I’ll burst! I\\r\\nhaven’t whispered to a soul--not a word--have had my countenance under\\r\\nlock and key, for fear it might drop something that would tell even\\r\\nthese animals here how to discern the gold mine that’s glaring under\\r\\ntheir noses. Now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it\\r\\nin the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly--five or ten\\r\\ndollars--the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an\\r\\nacre now, but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars,\\r\\nfifty dollars, a hundred dollars an acre! What should you say to” [here\\r\\nhe dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see\\r\\nthat there were no eavesdroppers,] “a thousand dollars an acre!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well you may open your eyes and stare! But it’s so. You and I may not\\r\\nsee the day, but they’ll see it. Mind I tell you; they’ll see it. Nancy,\\r\\nyou’ve heard of steamboats, and maybe you believed in them--of course\\r\\nyou did. You’ve heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies\\r\\nand humbugs,--but they’re not lies and humbugs, they’re a reality and\\r\\nthey’re going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now.\\r\\nThey’re going to make a revolution in this world’s affairs that will\\r\\nmake men dizzy to contemplate. I’ve been watching--I’ve been watching\\r\\nwhile some people slept, and I know what’s coming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that\\r\\nlittle Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours--and\\r\\nin high water they’ll come right to it! And this is not all, Nancy--it\\r\\nisn’t even half! There’s a bigger wonder--the railroad! These worms here\\r\\nhave never even heard of it--and when they do they’ll not believe in it.\\r\\nBut it’s another fact. Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an\\r\\nhour--heavens and earth, think of that, Nancy! Twenty miles an hour. It\\r\\nmakes a man’s brain whirl. Some day, when you and I are in our graves,\\r\\nthere’ll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles--all the way down\\r\\nfrom the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans--and its got to\\r\\nrun within thirty miles of this land--may be even touch a corner of\\r\\nit. Well, do you know, they’ve quit burning wood in some places in the\\r\\nEastern States? And what do you suppose they burn? Coal!” [He bent over\\r\\nand whispered again:] “There’s world--worlds of it on this land! You\\r\\nknow that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?--well,\\r\\nthat’s it. You’ve taken it for rocks; so has every body here; and\\r\\nthey’ve built little dams and such things with it. One man was going to\\r\\nbuild a chimney out of it. Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet!\\r\\nWhy, it might have caught fire and told everything. I showed him it\\r\\nwas too crumbly. Then he was going to build it of copper ore--splendid\\r\\nyellow forty-per-cent. ore! There’s fortunes upon fortunes of copper\\r\\nore on our land! It scared me to death, the idea of this fool starting\\r\\na smelting furnace in his house without knowing it, and getting his\\r\\ndull eyes opened. And then he was going to build it of iron ore! There’s\\r\\nmountains of iron ore here, Nancy--whole mountains of it. I wouldn’t\\r\\ntake any chances. I just stuck by him--I haunted him--I never let\\r\\nhim alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the\\r\\nchimneys in this dismal country. Pine forests, wheat land, corn land,\\r\\niron, copper, coal--wait till the railroads come, and the steamboats!\\r\\nWe’ll never see the day, Nancy--never in the world--never, never, never,\\r\\nchild. We’ve got to drag along, drag along, and eat crusts in toil and\\r\\npoverty, all hopeless and forlorn--but they’ll ride in coaches, Nancy!\\r\\nThey’ll live like the princes of the earth; they’ll be courted\\r\\nand worshiped; their names will be known from ocean to ocean! Ah,\\r\\nwell-a-day! Will they ever come back here, on the railroad and the\\r\\nsteamboat, and say, ‘This one little spot shall not be touched--this\\r\\nhovel shall be sacred--for here our father and our mother suffered for\\r\\nus, thought for us, laid the foundations of our future as solid as the\\r\\nhills!’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a great, good, noble soul, Si Hawkins, and I am an honored\\r\\nwoman to be the wife of such a man”--and the tears stood in her eyes\\r\\nwhen she said it. “We will go to Missouri. You are out of your place,\\r\\nhere, among these groping dumb creatures. We will find a higher place,\\r\\nwhere you can walk with your own kind, and be understood when you\\r\\nspeak--not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue. I would\\r\\ngo anywhere, anywhere in the wide world with you. I would rather my body\\r\\nwould starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in\\r\\nthis lonely land.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Spoken like yourself, my child! But we’ll not starve, Nancy. Far from\\r\\nit. I have a letter from Beriah Sellers--just came this day. A letter\\r\\nthat--I’ll read you a line from it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flew out of the room. A shadow blurred the sunlight in Nancy’s\\r\\nface--there was uneasiness in it, and disappointment. A procession of\\r\\ndisturbing thoughts began to troop through her mind. Saying nothing\\r\\naloud, she sat with her hands in her lap; now and then she clasped\\r\\nthem, then unclasped them, then tapped the ends of the fingers together;\\r\\nsighed, nodded, smiled--occasionally paused, shook her head. This\\r\\npantomime was the elocutionary expression of an unspoken soliloquy which\\r\\nhad something of this shape:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was afraid of it--was afraid of it. Trying to make our fortune\\r\\nin Virginia, Beriah Sellers nearly ruined us and we had to settle in\\r\\nKentucky and start over again. Trying to make our fortune in Kentucky\\r\\nhe crippled us again and we had to move here. Trying to make our fortune\\r\\nhere, he brought us clear down to the ground, nearly. He’s an honest\\r\\nsoul, and means the very best in the world, but I’m afraid, I’m afraid\\r\\nhe’s too flighty. He has splendid ideas, and he’ll divide his chances\\r\\nwith his friends with a free hand, the good generous soul, but something\\r\\ndoes seem to always interfere and spoil everything. I never did think\\r\\nhe was right well balanced. But I don’t blame my husband, for I do think\\r\\nthat when that man gets his head full of a new notion, he can out-talk a\\r\\nmachine. He’ll make anybody believe in that notion that’ll listen to him\\r\\nten minutes--why I do believe he would make a deaf and dumb man believe\\r\\nin it and get beside himself, if you only set him where he could see his\\r\\neyes tally and watch his hands explain. What a head he has got! When he\\r\\ngot up that idea there in Virginia of buying up whole loads of negroes\\r\\nin Delaware and Virginia and Tennessee, very quiet, having papers drawn\\r\\nto have them delivered at a place in Alabama and take them and pay for\\r\\nthem, away yonder at a certain time, and then in the meantime get a\\r\\nlaw made stopping everybody from selling negroes to the south after a\\r\\ncertain day--it was somehow that way--mercy how the man would have made\\r\\nmoney! Negroes would have gone up to four prices. But after he’d spent\\r\\nmoney and worked hard, and traveled hard, and had heaps of negroes all\\r\\ncontracted for, and everything going along just right, he couldn’t get\\r\\nthe laws passed and down the whole thing tumbled. And there in Kentucky,\\r\\nwhen he raked up that old numskull that had been inventing away at a\\r\\nperpetual motion machine for twenty-two years, and Beriah Sellers saw at\\r\\na glance where just one more little cog-wheel would settle the business,\\r\\nwhy I could see it as plain as day when he came in wild at midnight and\\r\\nhammered us out of bed and told the whole thing in a whisper with the\\r\\ndoors bolted and the candle in an empty barrel.\\r\\n\\r\\nOceans of money in it--anybody could see that. But it did cost a deal\\r\\nto buy the old numskull out--and then when they put the new cog wheel\\r\\nin they’d overlooked something somewhere and it wasn’t any use--the\\r\\ntroublesome thing wouldn’t go. That notion he got up here did look as\\r\\nhandy as anything in the world; and how him and Si did sit up nights\\r\\nworking at it with the curtains down and me watching to see if any\\r\\nneighbors were about. The man did honestly believe there was a fortune\\r\\nin that black gummy oil that stews out of the bank Si says is coal; and\\r\\nhe refined it himself till it was like water, nearly, and it did burn,\\r\\nthere’s no two ways about that; and I reckon he’d have been all right in\\r\\nCincinnati with his lamp that he got made, that time he got a house full\\r\\nof rich speculators to see him exhibit only in the middle of his speech\\r\\nit let go and almost blew the heads off the whole crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nI haven’t got over grieving for the money that cost yet. I am sorry\\r\\nenough Beriah Sellers is in Missouri, now, but I was glad when he went.\\r\\nI wonder what his letter says. But of course it’s cheerful; he’s never\\r\\ndown-hearted--never had any trouble in his life--didn’t know it if\\r\\nhe had. It’s always sunrise with that man, and fine and blazing, at\\r\\nthat--never gets noon, though--leaves off and rises again. Nobody can\\r\\nhelp liking the creature, he means so well--but I do dread to come\\r\\nacross him again; he’s bound to set us all crazy, of course. Well, there\\r\\ngoes old widow Hopkins--it always takes her a week to buy a spool of\\r\\nthread and trade a hank of yarn. Maybe Si can come with the letter,\\r\\nnow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he did:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Widow Hopkins kept me--I haven’t any patience with such tedious people.\\r\\nNow listen, Nancy--just listen at this:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Come right along to Missouri! Don’t wait and worry about a good price\\r\\nbut sell out for whatever you can get, and come along, or you might be\\r\\ntoo late. Throw away your traps, if necessary, and come empty-handed.\\r\\nYou’ll never regret it. It’s the grandest country--the loveliest\\r\\nland--the purest atmosphere--I can’t describe it; no pen can do it\\r\\njustice. And it’s filling up, every day--people coming from everywhere.\\r\\nI’ve got the biggest scheme on earth--and I’ll take you in; I’ll take\\r\\nin every friend I’ve got that’s ever stood by me, for there’s enough\\r\\nfor all, and to spare. Mum’s the word--don’t whisper--keep yourself to\\r\\nyourself. You’ll see! Come! --rush!--hurry!--don’t wait for anything!’\\r\\n“It’s the same old boy, Nancy, jest the same old boy--ain’t he?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I think there’s a little of the old sound about his voice yet. I\\r\\nsuppose you--you’ll still go, Si?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go! Well, I should think so, Nancy. It’s all a chance, of course, and,\\r\\nchances haven’t been kind to us, I’ll admit--but whatever comes, old\\r\\nwife, they’re provided for. Thank God for that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Amen,” came low and earnestly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with an activity and a suddenness that bewildered Obedstown and\\r\\nalmost took its breath away, the Hawkinses hurried through with their\\r\\narrangements in four short months and flitted out into the great\\r\\nmysterious blank that lay beyond the Knobs of Tennessee.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward the close of the third day’s journey the wayfarers were just\\r\\nbeginning to think of camping, when they came upon a log cabin in the\\r\\nwoods. Hawkins drew rein and entered the yard. A boy about ten years old\\r\\nwas sitting in the cabin door with his face bowed in his hands. Hawkins\\r\\napproached, expecting his footfall to attract attention, but it did not.\\r\\nHe halted a moment, and then said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, come, little chap, you mustn’t be going to sleep before sundown”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a tired expression the small face came up out of the hands,--a face\\r\\ndown which tears were flowing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, I’m sorry I spoke so, my boy. Tell me--is anything the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy signified with a scarcely perceptible gesture that the trouble\\r\\nwas in the house, and made room for Hawkins to pass. Then he put his\\r\\nface in his hands again and rocked himself about as one suffering a\\r\\ngrief that is too deep to find help in moan or groan or outcry.\\r\\nHawkins stepped within. It was a poverty stricken place. Six or eight\\r\\nmiddle-aged country people of both sexes were grouped about an object\\r\\nin the middle of the room; they were noiselessly busy and they talked\\r\\nin whispers when they spoke. Hawkins uncovered and approached. A coffin\\r\\nstood upon two backless chairs. These neighbors had just finished\\r\\ndisposing the body of a woman in it--a woman with a careworn, gentle\\r\\nface that had more the look of sleep about it than of death. An old lady\\r\\nmotioned, toward the door and said to Hawkins in a whisper:\\r\\n\\r\\n“His mother, po’ thing. Died of the fever, last night. Tha warn’t no\\r\\nsich thing as saving of her. But it’s better for her--better for her.\\r\\nHusband and the other two children died in the spring, and she hain’t\\r\\never hilt up her head sence. She jest went around broken-hearted like,\\r\\nand never took no intrust in anything but Clay--that’s the boy thar.\\r\\nShe jest worshiped Clay--and Clay he worshiped her. They didn’t ‘pear to\\r\\nlive at all, only when they was together, looking at each other, loving\\r\\none another. She’s ben sick three weeks; and if you believe me that\\r\\nchild has worked, and kep’ the run of the med’cin, and the times of\\r\\ngiving it, and sot up nights and nussed her, and tried to keep up her\\r\\nsperits, the same as a grown-up person. And last night when she kep’\\r\\na sinking and sinking, and turned away her head and didn’t know him no\\r\\nmo’, it was fitten to make a body’s heart break to see him climb onto\\r\\nthe bed and lay his cheek agin hern and call her so pitiful and she not\\r\\nanswer. But bymeby she roused up, like, and looked around wild, and then\\r\\nshe see him, and she made a great cry and snatched him to her breast and\\r\\nhilt him close and kissed him over and over agin; but it took the last\\r\\npo’ strength she had, and so her eyelids begin to close down, and her\\r\\narms sort o’ drooped away and then we see she was gone, po’ creetur. And\\r\\nClay, he--Oh, the po’ motherless thing--I cain’t talk about it--I cain’t\\r\\nbear to talk about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nClay had disappeared from the door; but he came in, now, and the\\r\\nneighbors reverently fell apart and made way for him. He leaned upon the\\r\\nopen coffin and let his tears course silently. Then he put out his small\\r\\nhand and smoothed the hair and stroked the dead face lovingly. After a\\r\\nbit he brought his other hand up from behind him and laid three or\\r\\nfour fresh wild flowers upon the breast, bent over and kissed the\\r\\nunresponsive lips time and time again, and then turned away and went out\\r\\nof the house without looking at any of the company. The old lady said to\\r\\nHawkins:\\r\\n\\r\\n“She always loved that kind o’ flowers. He fetched ‘em for her every\\r\\nmorning, and she always kissed him. They was from away north somers--she\\r\\nkep’ school when she fust come. Goodness knows what’s to become o’ that\\r\\npo’ boy. No father, no mother, no kin folks of no kind. Nobody to go\\r\\nto, nobody that k’yers for him--and all of us is so put to it for to get\\r\\nalong and families so large.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHawkins understood. All eyes were turned inquiringly upon him. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Friends, I am not very well provided for, myself, but still I would not\\r\\nturn my back on a homeless orphan. If he will go with me I will give him\\r\\na home, and loving regard--I will do for him as I would have another do\\r\\nfor a child of my own in misfortune.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne after another the people stepped forward and wrung the stranger’s\\r\\nhand with cordial good will, and their eyes looked all that their hands\\r\\ncould not express or their lips speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Said like a true man,” said one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You was a stranger to me a minute ago, but you ain’t now,” said\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s bread cast upon the waters--it’ll return after many days,” said\\r\\nthe old lady whom we have heard speak before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You got to camp in my house as long as you hang out here,” said one.\\r\\n“If tha hain’t room for you and yourn my tribe’ll turn out and camp in\\r\\nthe hay loft.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutes afterward, while the preparations for the funeral were\\r\\nbeing concluded, Mr. Hawkins arrived at his wagon leading his little\\r\\nwaif by the hand, and told his wife all that had happened, and asked her\\r\\nif he had done right in giving to her and to himself this new care? She\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you’ve done wrong, Si Hawkins, it’s a wrong that will shine brighter\\r\\nat the judgment day than the rights that many a man has done before you.\\r\\nAnd there isn’t any compliment you can pay me equal to doing a thing\\r\\nlike this and finishing it up, just taking it for granted that I’ll be\\r\\nwilling to it. Willing? Come to me; you poor motherless boy, and let me\\r\\ntake your grief and help you carry it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the child awoke in the morning, it was as if from a troubled dream.\\r\\nBut slowly the confusion in his mind took form, and he remembered his\\r\\ngreat loss; the beloved form in the coffin; his talk with a generous\\r\\nstranger who offered him a home; the funeral, where the stranger’s wife\\r\\nheld him by the hand at the grave, and cried with him and comforted\\r\\nhim; and he remembered how this, new mother tucked him in his bed in the\\r\\nneighboring farm house, and coaxed him to talk about his troubles, and\\r\\nthen heard him say his prayers and kissed him good night, and left him\\r\\nwith the soreness in his heart almost healed and his bruised spirit at\\r\\nrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the new mother came again, and helped him to dress, and combed\\r\\nhis hair, and drew his mind away by degrees from the dismal yesterday,\\r\\nby telling him about the wonderful journey he was going to take and the\\r\\nstrange things he was going to see. And after breakfast they two went\\r\\nalone to the grave, and his heart went out to his new friend and his\\r\\nuntaught eloquence poured the praises of his buried idol into her ears\\r\\nwithout let or hindrance. Together they planted roses by the headboard\\r\\nand strewed wild flowers upon the grave; and then together they went\\r\\naway, hand in hand, and left the dead to the long sleep that heals all\\r\\nheart-aches and ends all sorrows.\\r\\n')]"

       "  'emma lume i i emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister’s marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr woodhouse’s family less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming miss taylor’s judgment but directed chiefly by her own the real evils indeed of emma’s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments the danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness miss taylor married it was miss taylor’s loss which first brought grief it was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance the wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost the event had every promise of happiness for her friend mr weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black morning’s work for her the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day she recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella’s marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent well informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault how was she to bear the change it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs weston only half a mile from them and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her no equals the woodhouses were first in consequence there all looked up to them she had many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day it was a melancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful his spirits required support he was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner “poor miss taylor i wish she were here again what a pity it is that mr weston ever thought of her ” “i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot mr weston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own ” “a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear ” “how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us we shall be always meeting _we_ must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon ” “my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance i could not walk half so far ” “no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage to be sure ” “the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ” “they are to be put into mr weston’s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter’s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you ” “i am very glad i did think of her it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil pretty spoken girl i have a great opinion of her whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us he will be able to tell her how we all are ” emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own the backgammon table was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary mr knightley a sensible man about seven or eight and thirty was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabella’s husband he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london he had returned to a late dinner after some days’ absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square it was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time mr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after “poor isabella” and her children were answered most satisfactorily when this was over mr woodhouse gratefully observed “it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk ” “not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire ” “but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not catch cold ” “dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them ” “well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding ” “by the bye i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most ” “ah poor miss taylor ‘tis a sad business ” “poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say ‘poor miss taylor ’ i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two ” “especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature ” said emma playfully “that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by ” “i believe it is very true my dear indeed ” said mr woodhouse with a sigh “i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome ” “my dearest papa you do not think i could mean _you_ or suppose mr knightley to mean _you_ what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another ” mr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body “emma knows i never flatter her ” said mr knightley “but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer ” “well ” said emma willing to let it pass “you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day ” “dear emma bears every thing so well ” said her father “but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for ” emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles “it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion ” said mr knightley “we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor’s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor’s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married ” “and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ” said emma “and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing ” mr knightley shook his head at her her father fondly replied “ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches ” “i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know every body said that mr weston would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it “ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell’s i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off match making ” “i do not understand what you mean by ‘success ’” said mr knightley “success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady’s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day ‘i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her ’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and _that_ is all that can be said ” “and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word ‘success ’ which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston’s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that ” “a straightforward open hearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference ” “emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others ” rejoined mr woodhouse understanding but in part “but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one’s family circle grievously ” “only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service ” “mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day that will be a much better thing i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him ” “with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time ” said mr knightley laughing “and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself ” ii mr weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property he had received a good education but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortune though her fortune bore no proportion to the family estate was not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the infinite mortification of mr and mrs churchill who threw her off with due decorum it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness mrs weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’s unreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years’ marriage he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved the boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother’s been the means of a sort of reconciliation and mr and mrs churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease some scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could a complete change of life became desirable he quitted the militia and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening it was a concern which brought just employment enough he had still a small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away he had by that time realised an easy competence enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a well judging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it he had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was his own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle’s heir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his father’s assistance his father had no apprehension of it the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely but it was not in mr weston’s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern mr frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved now upon his father’s marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention that the visit should take place there was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when mrs perry drank tea with mrs and miss bates or when mrs and miss bates returned the visit now was the time for mr frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs weston had received “i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written to mrs weston i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed mr woodhouse told me of it mr woodhouse saw the letter and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life ” it was indeed a highly prized letter mrs weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured she felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her she knew that at times she must be missed and could not think without pain of emma’s losing a single pleasure or suffering an hour’s ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield so convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr weston’s disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs weston and of moments only of regret and her satisfaction her more than satisfaction her cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ‘poor miss taylor ’ when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own but never did she go without mr woodhouse’s giving a gentle sigh and saying “ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay ” there was no recovering miss taylor nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr woodhouse the compliments of his neighbours were over he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event and the wedding cake which had been a great distress to him was all eat up his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be different from himself what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly tried to prevent any body’s eating it he had been at the pains of consulting mr perry the apothecary on the subject mr perry was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr woodhouse’s life and upon being applied to he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that wedding cake might certainly disagree with many perhaps with most people unless taken moderately with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs weston’s wedding cake in their hands but mr woodhouse would never believe it'),\n",

       "  'northanger abbey no one who had ever seen catherine morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine her situation in life the character of her father and mother her own person and disposition were all equally against her her father was a clergyman without being neglected or poor and a very respectable man though his name was richard and he had never been handsome he had a considerable independence besides two good livings and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters her mother was a woman of useful plain sense with a good temper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution she had three sons before catherine was born and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world as anybody might expect she still lived on lived to have six children more to see them growing up around her and to enjoy excellent health herself a family of ten children will be always called a fine family where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number but the morlands had little other right to the word for they were in general very plain and catherine for many years of her life as plain as any she had a thin awkward figure a sallow skin without colour dark lank hair and strong features so much for her person and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind she was fond of all boy’s plays and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy nursing a dormouse feeding a canary bird or watering a rose bush indeed she had no taste for a garden and if she gathered flowers at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take such were her propensities her abilities were quite as extraordinary she never could learn or understand anything before she was taught and sometimes not even then for she was often inattentive and occasionally stupid her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the “beggar’s petition” and after all her next sister sally could say it better than she did not that catherine was always stupid by no means she learnt the fable of “the hare and many friends” as quickly as any girl in england her mother wished her to learn music and catherine was sure she should like it for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet so at eight years old she began she learnt a year and could not bear it and mrs morland who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste allowed her to leave off the day which dismissed the music master was one of the happiest of catherine’s life her taste for drawing was not superior though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper she did what she could in that way by drawing houses and trees hens and chickens all very much like one another writing and accounts she was taught by her father french by her mother her proficiency in either was not remarkable and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could what a strange unaccountable character for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper was seldom stubborn scarcely ever quarrelsome and very kind to the little ones with few interruptions of tyranny she was moreover noisy and wild hated confinement and cleanliness and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house such was catherine morland at ten at fifteen appearances were mending she began to curl her hair and long for balls her complexion improved her features were softened by plumpness and colour her eyes gained more animation and her figure more consequence her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery and she grew clean as she grew smart she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement “catherine grows quite a good looking girl she is almost pretty today ” were words which caught her ears now and then and how welcome were the sounds to look almost pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive mrs morland was a very good woman and wished to see her children everything they ought to be but her time was so much occupied in lying in and teaching the little ones that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves and it was not very wonderful that catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket baseball riding on horseback and running about the country at the age of fourteen to books or at least books of information for provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them provided they were all story and no reflection she had never any objection to books at all but from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives from pope she learnt to censure those who “bear about the mockery of woe ” from gray that “many a flower is born to blush unseen “and waste its fragrance on the desert air ” from thompson that “it is a delightful task “to teach the young idea how to shoot ” and from shakespeare she gained a great store of information amongst the rest that “trifles light as air “are to the jealous confirmation strong “as proofs of holy writ ” that “the poor beetle which we tread upon “in corporal sufferance feels a pang as great “as when a giant dies ” and that a young woman in love always looks “like patience on a monument “smiling at grief ” so far her improvement was sufficient and in many other points she came on exceedingly well for though she could not write sonnets she brought herself to read them and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte of her own composition she could listen to other people’s performance with very little fatigue her greatest deficiency was in the pencil she had no notion of drawing not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover’s profile that she might be detected in the design there she fell miserably short of the true heroic height at present she did not know her own poverty for she had no lover to portray she had reached the age of seventeen without having seen one amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility without having inspired one real passion and without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate and very transient this was strange indeed but strange things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out there was not one lord in the neighbourhood no not even a baronet there was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door not one young man whose origin was unknown her father had no ward and the squire of the parish no children but when a young lady is to be a heroine the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way mr allen who owned the chief of the property about fullerton the village in wiltshire where the morlands lived was ordered to bath for the benefit of a gouty constitution and his lady a good humoured woman fond of miss morland and probably aware that if adventures will not befall a young lady in her own village she must seek them abroad invited her to go with them mr and mrs morland were all compliance and catherine all happiness in addition to what has been already said of catherine morland’s personal and mental endowments when about to be launched into all the difficulties and dangers of a six weeks’ residence in bath it may be stated for the reader’s more certain information lest the following pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her character is meant to be that her heart was affectionate her disposition cheerful and open without conceit or affectation of any kind her manners just removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl her person pleasing and when in good looks pretty and her mind about as ignorant and uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is when the hour of departure drew near the maternal anxiety of mrs morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe a thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet cautions against the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young ladies away to some remote farm house must at such a moment relieve the fulness of her heart who would not think so but mrs morland knew so little of lords and baronets that she entertained no notion of their general mischievousness and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her daughter from their machinations her cautions were confined to the following points “i beg catherine you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat when you come from the rooms at night and i wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend i will give you this little book on purpose ” sally or rather sarah for what young lady of common gentility will reach the age of sixteen without altering her name as far as she can must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister it is remarkable however that she neither insisted on catherine’s writing by every post nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance nor a detail of every interesting conversation that bath might produce everything indeed relative to this important journey was done on the part of the morlands with a degree of moderation and composure which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life than with the refined susceptibilities the tender emotions which the first separation of a heroine from her family ought always to excite her father instead of giving her an unlimited order on his banker or even putting an hundred pounds bank bill into her hands gave her only ten guineas and promised her more when she wanted it under these unpromising auspices the parting took place and the journey began it was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful safety neither robbers nor tempests befriended them nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero nothing more alarming occurred than a fear on mrs allen’s side of having once left her clogs behind her at an inn and that fortunately proved to be groundless they arrived at bath catherine was all eager delight her eyes were here there everywhere as they approached its fine and striking environs and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel she was come to be happy and she felt happy already they were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in pulteney street it is now expedient to give some description of mrs allen that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work and how she will probably contribute to reduce poor catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable whether by her imprudence vulgarity or jealousy whether by intercepting her letters ruining her character or turning her out of doors mrs allen was one of that numerous class of females whose society can raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough to marry them she had neither beauty genius accomplishment nor manner the air of a gentlewoman a great deal of quiet inactive good temper and a trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice of a sensible intelligent man like mr allen in one respect she was admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public being as fond of going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be dress was her passion she had a most harmless delight in being fine and our heroine’s entree into life could not take place till after three or four days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn and her chaperone was provided with a dress of the newest fashion catherine too made some purchases herself and when all these matters were arranged the important evening came which was to usher her into the upper rooms her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand her clothes put on with care and both mrs allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do with such encouragement catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd as for admiration it was always very welcome when it came but she did not depend on it mrs allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late the season was full the room crowded and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could as for mr allen he repaired directly to the card room and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves with more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protegee mrs allen made her way through the throng of men by the door as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow catherine however kept close at her side and linked her arm too firmly within her friend’s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly but to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd it seemed rather to increase as they went on whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience but this was far from being the case and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the top of the room their situation was just the same they saw nothing of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies still they moved on something better was yet in view and by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind the highest bench here there was something less of crowd than below and hence miss morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her and of all the dangers of her late passage through them it was a splendid sight and she began for the first time that evening to feel herself at a ball she longed to dance but she had not an acquaintance in the room mrs allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly every now and then “i wish you could dance my dear i wish you could get a partner ” for some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes but they were repeated so often and proved so totally ineffectual that catherine grew tired at last and would thank her no more they were not long able however to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained everybody was shortly in motion for tea and they must squeeze out like the rest catherine began to feel something of disappointment she was tired of being continually pressed against by people the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives and when at last arrived in the tea room she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join no acquaintance to claim no gentleman to assist them they saw nothing of mr allen and after looking about them in vain for a more eligible situation were obliged to sit down at the end of a table at which a large party were already placed without having anything to do there or anybody to speak to except each other mrs allen congratulated herself as soon as they were seated on having preserved her gown from injury “it would have been very shocking to have it torn ” said she “would not it it is such a delicate muslin for my part i have not seen anything i like so well in the whole room i assure you ” “how uncomfortable it is ” whispered catherine “not to have a single acquaintance here ” “yes my dear ” replied mrs allen with perfect serenity “it is very uncomfortable indeed ” “what shall we do the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here we seem forcing ourselves into their party ” “aye so we do that is very disagreeable i wish we had a large acquaintance here ” “i wish we had any it would be somebody to go to ” “very true my dear and if we knew anybody we would join them directly the skinners were here last year i wish they were here now ” “had not we better go away as it is here are no tea things for us you see ” “no more there are indeed how very provoking but i think we had better sit still for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd how is my head my dear somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid ” “no indeed it looks very nice but dear mrs allen are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people i think you must know somebody ” “i don’t upon my word i wish i did i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner i should be so glad to have you dance there goes a strange looking woman what an odd gown she has got on how old fashioned it is look at the back ” after some time they received an offer of tea from one of their neighbours it was thankfully accepted and this introduced a light conversation with the gentleman who offered it which was the only time that anybody spoke to them during the evening till they were discovered and joined by mr allen when the dance was over “well miss morland ” said he directly “i hope you have had an agreeable ball ” “very agreeable indeed ” she replied vainly endeavouring to hide a great yawn “i wish she had been able to dance ” said his wife “i wish we could have got a partner for her i have been saying how glad i should be if the skinners were here this winter instead of last or if the parrys had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry i am so sorry she has not had a partner ” “we shall do better another evening i hope ” was mr allen’s consolation the company began to disperse when the dancing was over enough to leave space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort and now was the time for a heroine who had not yet played a very distinguished part in the events of the evening to be noticed and admired every five minutes by removing some of the crowd gave greater openings for her charms she was now seen by many young men who had not been near her before not one however started with rapturous wonder on beholding her no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room nor was she once called a divinity by anybody yet catherine was in very good looks and had the company only seen her three years before they would now have thought her exceedingly handsome she was looked at however and with some admiration for in her own hearing two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl such words had their due effect she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before her humble vanity was contented she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms and went to her chair in good humour with everybody and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention'),\n",

       "  \"persuasion sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened elliot of kellynch hall walter elliot born march married july elizabeth daughter of james stevenson esq of south park in the county of gloucester by which lady who died he has issue elizabeth born june anne born august a still born son november mary born november precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's hands but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of himself and his family these words after the date of mary's birth married december charles son and heir of charles musgrove esq of uppercross in the county of somerset and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff representing a borough in three successive parliaments exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with the arms and motto principal seat kellynch hall in the county of somerset and sir walter's handwriting again in this finale heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson of the second sir walter vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot's character vanity of person and of situation he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at fifty four was still a very fine man few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own lady elliot had been an excellent woman sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwards she had humoured or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance thirteen years had passed away since lady elliot's death and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower the other a widow that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not but sir walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing which he had not been very much tempted to do elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of her mother's rights and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together most happily his two other children were of very inferior value mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way she was only anne to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued god daughter favourite and friend lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about lady russell's temples had long been a distress to him elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within the next twelvemonth or two then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot's death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year but he never came the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come and the next tidings were that he was married instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth sir walter had resented it as the head of the house he felt that he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together he observed once at tattersall's and twice in the lobby of the house of commons his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded mr elliot had attempted no apology and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family as sir walter considered him unworthy of it all acquaintance between them had ceased this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her father's heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliot's eldest daughter there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present time the summer of wearing black ribbons for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own this could not be pardoned such were elizabeth elliot's sentiments and sensations such the cares to alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life such the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence in one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these her father was growing distressed for money she knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts the kellynch property was good but not equal to sir walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor while lady elliot lived there had been method moderation and economy which had just kept him within his income but with her had died all such right mindedness and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it it had not been possible for him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was not only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially from his daughter he had given her some hints of it the last spring in town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing room to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne as had been the usual yearly custom but these measures however good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy she felt herself ill used and unfortunate as did her father and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power but he would never condescend to sell no he would never disgrace his name so far the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire as he had received it their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in the neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it much serious consideration she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour but she was as desirous of saving sir walter's feelings as solicitous for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them herself the widow of only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations and she did what nobody else thought of doing she consulted anne who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter every emendation of anne's had been on the side of honesty against importance she wanted more vigorous measures a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell looking over her paper much may be done if he will adopt these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families have done or ought to do there will be nothing singular in his case and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering as it always does of our conduct i have great hope of prevailing we must be serious and decided for after all the person who has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father there is still more due to the character of an honest man this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding his friends to be urging him she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty she rated lady russell's influence highly and as to the severe degree of self denial which her own conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete than to half a reformation her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on through the whole list of lady russell's too gentle reductions how anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence lady russell's had no success at all could not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort of life knocked off journeys london servants horses table contractions and restrictions every where to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms quit kellynch hall the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter's retrenching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go was settled and the first outline of this important change made out there had been three alternatives london bath or another house in the country all anne's wishes had been for the latter a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russell's society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her ambition but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her and bath was to be her home sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell's spending some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne's known wishes it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter's feelings they must have been dreadful and with regard to anne's dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there after her mother's death and secondly from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must suit them all and as to her young friend's health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good anne had been too little from home too little seen her spirits were not high a larger society would improve them she wanted her to be more known the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning he was not only to quit his home but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude which stronger heads than sir walter's have found too much kellynch hall was to be let this however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house mr shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour that he would let it at all how quick come the reasons for approving what we like lady russell had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an unprosperous marriage to her father's house with the additional burden of two children she was a clever young woman who understood the art of pleasing the art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility from situation mrs clay was in lady russell's estimate a very unequal and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliot's reach was therefore an object of first rate importance\"),\n",

       "  'pride and prejudice it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters “my dear mr bennet ” said his lady to him one day “have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ” mr bennet replied that he had not “but it is ” returned she “for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it ” mr bennet made no answer “do you not want to know who has taken it ” cried his wife impatiently “_you_ want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it ” this was invitation enough “why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week ” “what is his name ” “bingley ” “is he married or single ” “oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls ” “how so how can it affect them ” “my dear mr bennet ” replied his wife “how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them ” “is that his design in settling here ” “design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes ” “i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley may like you the best of the party ” “my dear you flatter me i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty ” “in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of ” “but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood ” “it is more than i engage for i assure you ” “but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not ” “you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy ” “i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia but you are always giving _her_ the preference ” “they have none of them much to recommend them ” replied he “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters ” “mr bennet how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion for my poor nerves ” “you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least ” “ah you do not know what i suffer ” “but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood ” “it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them ” “depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all ” mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character _her_ mind was less difficult to develop she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with “i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy ” “we are not in a way to know _what_ mr bingley likes ” said her mother resentfully “since we are not to visit ” “but you forget mamma ” said elizabeth “that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce him ” “i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her ” “no more have i ” said mr bennet “and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you ” mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters “don’t keep coughing so kitty for heaven’s sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces ” “kitty has no discretion in her coughs ” said her father “she times them ill ” “i do not cough for my own amusement ” replied kitty fretfully “when is your next ball to be lizzy ” “to morrow fortnight ” “aye so it is ” cried her mother “and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself ” “then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to _her_ ” “impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing ” “i honour your circumspection a fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if _we_ do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her neices must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself ” the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only “nonsense nonsense ” “what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ” cried he “do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you _there_ what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts ” mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how “while mary is adjusting her ideas ” he continued “let us return to mr bingley ” “i am sick of mr bingley ” cried his wife “i am sorry to hear _that_ but why did not you tell me that before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now ” the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while “how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now ” “now kitty you may cough as much as you choose ” said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife “what an excellent father you have girls ” said she when the door was shut “i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you _are_ the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball ” “oh ” said lydia stoutly “i am not afraid for though i _am_ the youngest i’m the tallest ” the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet’s visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner'),\n",

       "  \"sense and sensibility the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex their estate was large and their residence was at norland park in the centre of their property where for many generations they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance the late owner of this estate was a single man who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of his life had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister but her death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home for to supply her loss he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr henry dashwood the legal inheritor of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it in the society of his nephew and niece and their children the old gentleman's days were comfortably spent his attachment to them all increased the constant attention of mr and mrs henry dashwood to his wishes which proceeded not merely from interest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence by a former marriage mr henry dashwood had one son by his present lady three daughters the son a steady respectable young man was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother which had been large and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age by his own marriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to his wealth to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters for their fortune independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property could be but small their mother had nothing and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child and he had only a life interest in it the old gentleman died his will was read and like almost every other will gave as much disappointment as pleasure he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest mr dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son but to his son and his son's son a child of four years old it was secured in such a way as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate or by any sale of its valuable woods the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and mother at norland had so far gained on the affections of his uncle by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which for years he had received from his niece and her daughters he meant not to be unkind however and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a thousand pounds a piece mr dashwood's disappointment was at first severe but his temper was cheerful and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many years and by living economically lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate improvement but the fortune which had been so tardy in coming was his only one twelvemonth he survived his uncle no longer and ten thousand pounds including the late legacies was all that remained for his widow and daughters his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him mr dashwood recommended with all the strength and urgency which illness could command the interest of his mother in law and sisters mr john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable his father was rendered easy by such an assurance and mr john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them he was not an ill disposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill disposed but he was in general well respected for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties had he married a more amiable woman he might have been made still more respectable than he was he might even have been made amiable himself for he was very young when he married and very fond of his wife but mrs john dashwood was a strong caricature of himself more narrow minded and selfish when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a piece he then really thought himself equal to it the prospect of four thousand a year in addition to his present income besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune warmed his heart and made him feel capable of generosity yes he would give them three thousand pounds it would be liberal and handsome it would be enough to make them completely easy three thousand pounds he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience he thought of it all day long and for many days successively and he did not repent no sooner was his father's funeral over than mrs john dashwood without sending any notice of her intention to her mother in law arrived with her child and their attendants no one could dispute her right to come the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater and to a woman in mrs dashwood's situation with only common feelings must have been highly unpleasing but in her mind there was a sense of honor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source of immovable disgust mrs john dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family but she had had no opportunity till the present of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it so acutely did mrs dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour and so earnestly did she despise her daughter in law for it that on the arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence she had an excellent heart her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught marianne's abilities were in many respects quite equal to elinor's she was sensible and clever but eager in everything her sorrows her joys could have no moderation she was generous amiable interesting she was everything but prudent the resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great elinor saw with concern the excess of her sister's sensibility but by mrs dashwood it was valued and cherished they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction the agony of grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought for was created again and again they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future elinor too was deeply afflicted but still she could struggle she could exert herself she could consult with her brother could receive her sister in law on her arrival and treat her with proper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance margaret the other sister was a good humored well disposed girl but as she had already imbibed a good deal of marianne's romance without having much of her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life mrs john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland and her mother and sisters in law were degraded to the condition of visitors as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself his wife and their child he really pressed them with some earnestness to consider norland as their home and as no plan appeared so eligible to mrs dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood his invitation was accepted a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight was exactly what suited her mind in seasons of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess in a greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy mrs john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree she begged him to think again on the subject how could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum and what possible claim could the miss dashwoods who were related to him only by half blood which she considered as no relationship at all have on his generosity to so large an amount it was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages and why was he to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his money to his half sisters it was my father's last request to me replied her husband that i should assist his widow and daughters he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he was light headed at the time had he been in his right senses he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider she added that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy why to be sure said her husband very gravely that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition to be sure it would perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and as it is only half blood but you have such a generous spirit i would not wish to do any thing mean he replied one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more there is no knowing what they may expect said the lady but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a piece as it is without any addition of mine they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother's death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them something of the annuity kind i mean my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this plan to be sure said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father's will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother's disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income one's fortune as your mother justly says is not one's own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one's independence undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something upon my word said mr dashwood i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then certainly returned mrs john dashwood but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in but however so it is your father thought only of them and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to them this argument was irresistible it gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before and he finally resolved that it would be absolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for the widow and children of his father than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out\"),\n",

       "  \"a christmas carol stave one marley's ghost marley was dead to begin with there is no doubt whatever about that the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner scrooge signed it and scrooge's name was good upon 'change for anything he chose to put his hand to old marley was as dead as a door nail mind i don't mean to say that i know of my own knowledge what there is particularly dead about a door nail i might have been inclined myself to regard a coffin nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or the country's done for you will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that marley was as dead as a door nail scrooge knew he was dead of course he did how could it be otherwise scrooge and he were partners for i don't know how many years scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain the mention of marley's funeral brings me back to the point i started from there is no doubt that marley was dead this must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate if we were not perfectly convinced that hamlet's father died before the play began there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night in an easterly wind upon his own ramparts than there would be in any other middle aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot say st paul's church yard for instance literally to astonish his son's weak mind scrooge never painted out old marley's name there it stood years afterwards above the warehouse door scrooge and marley the firm was known as scrooge and marley sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names it was all the same to him oh but he was a tight fisted hand at the grindstone scrooge a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire secret and self contained and solitary as an oyster the cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed nose shrivelled his cheek stiffened his gait made his eyes red his thin lips blue and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice a frosty rime was on his head and on his eyebrows and his wiry chin he carried his own low temperature always about with him he iced his office in the dog days and didn't thaw it one degree at christmas external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge no warmth could warm no wintry weather chill him no wind that blew was bitterer than he no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose no pelting rain less open to entreaty foul weather didn't know where to have him the heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect they often came down handsomely and scrooge never did nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks my dear scrooge how are you when will you come to see me no beggars implored him to bestow a trifle no children asked him what it was o'clock no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place of scrooge even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him and when they saw him coming on would tug their owners into doorways and up courts and then would wag their tails as though they said no eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master but what did scrooge care it was the very thing he liked to edge his way along the crowded paths of life warning all human sympathy to keep its distance was what the knowing ones call nuts to scrooge once upon a time of all the good days in the year on christmas eve old scrooge sat busy in his counting house it was cold bleak biting weather foggy withal and he could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down beating their hands upon their breasts and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them the city clocks had only just gone three but it was quite dark already it had not been light all day and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air the fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was so dense without that although the court was of the narrowest the houses opposite were mere phantoms to see the dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring everything one might have thought that nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale the door of scrooge's counting house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank was copying letters scrooge had a very small fire but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal but he couldn't replenish it for scrooge kept the coal box in his own room and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to warm himself at the candle in which effort not being a man of strong imagination he failed a merry christmas uncle god save you cried a cheerful voice it was the voice of scrooge's nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach bah said scrooge humbug he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this nephew of scrooge's that he was all in a glow his face was ruddy and handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again christmas a humbug uncle said scrooge's nephew you don't mean that i am sure i do said scrooge merry christmas what right have you to be merry what reason have you to be merry you're poor enough come then returned the nephew gaily what right have you to be dismal what reason have you to be morose you're rich enough scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said bah again and followed it up with humbug don't be cross uncle said the nephew illustration _ a merry christmas uncle god save you cried a cheerful voice _ what else can i be returned the uncle when i live in such a world of fools as this merry christmas out upon merry christmas what's christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money a time for finding yourself a year older and not an hour richer a time for balancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you if i could work my will said scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with 'merry christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart he should uncle pleaded the nephew nephew returned the uncle sternly keep christmas in your own way and let me keep it in mine keep it repeated scrooge's nephew but you don't keep it let me leave it alone then said scrooge much good may it do you much good it has ever done you there are many things from which i might have derived good by which i have not profited i dare say returned the nephew christmas among the rest but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time when it has come round apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from that as a good time a kind forgiving charitable pleasant time the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut up hearts freely and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys and therefore uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket i believe that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good and i say god bless it the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark for ever let me hear another sound from _you_ said scrooge and you'll keep your christmas by losing your situation you're quite a powerful speaker sir he added turning to his nephew i wonder you don't go into parliament don't be angry uncle come dine with us to morrow scrooge said that he would see him yes indeed he did he went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity first but why cried scrooge's nephew why why did you get married said scrooge because i fell in love because you fell in love growled scrooge as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas good afternoon nay uncle but you never came to see me before that happened why give it as a reason for not coming now good afternoon said scrooge i want nothing from you i ask nothing of you why cannot we be friends good afternoon said scrooge i am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute we have never had any quarrel to which i have been a party but i have made the trial in homage to christmas and i'll keep my christmas humour to the last so a merry christmas uncle good afternoon said scrooge and a happy new year good afternoon said scrooge his nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold as he was was warmer than scrooge for he returned them cordially there's another fellow muttered scrooge who overheard him my clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking about a merry christmas i'll retire to bedlam this lunatic in letting scrooge's nephew out had let two other people in they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in scrooge's office they had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him scrooge and marley's i believe said one of the gentlemen referring to his list have i the pleasure of addressing mr scrooge or mr marley mr marley has been dead these seven years scrooge replied he died seven years ago this very night we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner said the gentleman presenting his credentials it certainly was for they had been two kindred spirits at the ominous word liberality scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back at this festive season of the year mr scrooge said the gentleman taking up a pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir are there no prisons asked scrooge plenty of prisons said the gentleman laying down the pen again and the union workhouses demanded scrooge are they still in operation they are still returned the gentleman i wish i could say they were not the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then said scrooge both very busy sir oh i was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course said scrooge i am very glad to hear it under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude returned the gentleman a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth we choose this time because it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices what shall i put you down for nothing scrooge replied you wish to be anonymous i wish to be left alone said scrooge since you ask me what i wish gentlemen that is my answer i don't make merry myself at christmas and i can't afford to make idle people merry i help to support the establishments i have mentioned they cost enough and those who are badly off must go there many can't go there and many would rather die if they would rather die said scrooge they had better do it and decrease the surplus population besides excuse me i don't know that but you might know it observed the gentleman it's not my business scrooge returned it's enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other people's mine occupies me constantly good afternoon gentlemen seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the gentlemen withdrew scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with flaring links proffering their services to go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way the ancient tower of a church whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall became invisible and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there the cold became intense in the main street at the corner of the court some labourers were repairing the gas pipes and had lighted a great fire in a brazier round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture the water plug being left in solitude its overflowings suddenly congealed and turned to misanthropic ice the brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows made pale faces ruddy as they passed poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke a glorious pageant with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do the lord mayor in the stronghold of the mighty mansion house gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep christmas as a lord mayor's household should and even the little tailor whom he had fined five shillings on the previous monday for being drunk and blood thirsty in the streets stirred up to morrow's pudding in his garret while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef foggier yet and colder piercing searching biting cold if the good st dunstan had but nipped the evil spirit's nose with a touch of such weather as that instead of using his familiar weapons then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose the owner of one scant young nose gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs stooped down at scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a christmas carol but at the first sound of god bless you merry gentleman may nothing you dismay scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost at length the hour of shutting up the counting house arrived with an ill will scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat you'll want all day to morrow i suppose said scrooge if quite convenient sir it's not convenient said scrooge and it's not fair if i was to stop half a crown for it you'd think yourself ill used i'll be bound the clerk smiled faintly and yet said scrooge you don't think _me_ ill used when i pay a day's wages for no work the clerk observed that it was only once a year a poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty fifth of december said scrooge buttoning his great coat to the chin but i suppose you must have the whole day be here all the earlier next morning the clerk promised that he would and scrooge walked out with a growl the office was closed in a twinkling and the clerk with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist for he boasted no great coat went down a slide on cornhill at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in honour of its being christmas eve and then ran home to camden town as hard as he could pelt to play at blindman's buff scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker's book went home to bed he lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner they were a gloomy suite of rooms in a lowering pile of building up a yard where it had so little business to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house playing at hide and seek with other houses and have forgotten the way out again it was old enough now and dreary enough for nobody lived in it but scrooge the other rooms being all let out as offices the yard was so dark that even scrooge who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it was very large it is also a fact that scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence in that place also that scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of london even including which is a bold word the corporation aldermen and livery let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his last mention of his seven years' dead partner that afternoon and then let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate process of change not a knocker but marley's face marley's face it was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge as marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead the hair was curiously stirred as if by breath of hot air and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly motionless that and its livid colour made it horrible but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control rather than a part of its own expression as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it was a knocker again to say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished turned it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle he _did_ pause with a moment's irresolution before he shut the door and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall but there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh and closed it with a bang the sound resounded through the house like thunder every room above and every cask in the wine merchant's cellars below appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes he fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the stairs slowly too trimming his candle as he went you may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight of stairs or through a bad young act of parliament but i mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase and taken it broadwise with the splinter bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades and done it easy there was plenty of width for that and room to spare which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom half a dozen gas lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooge's dip up scrooge went not caring a button for that darkness is cheap and scrooge liked it but before he shut his heavy door he walked through his rooms to see that all was right he had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that sitting room bedroom lumber room all as they should be nobody under the table nobody under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel scrooge had a cold in his head upon the hob nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in his dressing gown which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall lumber room as usual old fire guard old shoes two fish baskets washing stand on three legs and a poker quite satisfied he closed his door and locked himself in double locked himself in which was not his custom thus secured against surprise he took off his cravat put on his dressing gown and slippers and his nightcap and sat down before the fire to take his gruel it was a very low fire indeed nothing on such a bitter night he was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel the fire place was an old one built by some dutch merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures there were cains and abels pharaoh's daughters queens of sheba angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather beds abrahams belshazzars apostles putting off to sea in butter boats hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts and yet that face of marley seven years dead came like the ancient prophet's rod and swallowed up the whole if each smooth tile had been a blank at first with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would have been a copy of old marley's head on every one humbug said scrooge and walked across the room after several turns he sat down again as he threw his head back in the chair his glance happened to rest upon a bell a disused bell that hung in the room and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building it was with great astonishment and with a strange inexplicable dread that as he looked he saw this bell begin to swing it swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound but soon it rang out loudly and so did every bell in the house this might have lasted half a minute or a minute but it seemed an hour the bells ceased as they had begun together they were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant's cellar scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains the cellar door flew open with a booming sound and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors below then coming up the stairs then coming straight towards his door it's humbug still said scrooge i won't believe it his colour changed though when without a pause it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes upon its coming in the dying flame leaped up as though it cried i know him marley's ghost and fell again the same face the very same marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his coat skirts and the hair upon his head the chain he drew was clasped about his middle it was long and wound about him like a tail and it was made for scrooge observed it closely of cash boxes keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel his body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no bowels but he had never believed it until now no nor did he believe it even now though he looked the phantom through and through and saw it standing before him though he felt the chilling influence of its death cold eyes and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin which wrapper he had not observed before he was still incredulous and fought against his senses how now said scrooge caustic and cold as ever what do you want with me much marley's voice no doubt about it who are you ask me who i _was_ who _were_ you then said scrooge raising his voice you're particular for a shade he was going to say _to_ a shade but substituted this as more appropriate in life i was your partner jacob marley can you can you sit down asked scrooge looking doubtfully at him i can do it then scrooge asked the question because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair and felt that in the event of its being impossible it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation but the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fire place as if he were quite used to it you don't believe in me observed the ghost i don't said scrooge what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own senses i don't know said scrooge why do you doubt your senses because said scrooge a little thing affects them a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats you may be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato there's more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then the truth is that he tried to be smart as a means of distracting his own attention and keeping down his terror for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him there was something very awful too in the spectre's being provided with an infernal atmosphere of his own scrooge could not feel it himself but this was clearly the case for though the ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven you see this toothpick said scrooge returning quickly to the charge for the reason just assigned and wishing though it were only for a second to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself i do replied the ghost you are not looking at it said scrooge but i see it said the ghost notwithstanding well returned scrooge i have but to swallow this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins all of my own creation humbug i tell you humbug at this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise that scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in a swoon but how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round his head as if it were too warm to wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face mercy he said dreadful apparition why do you trouble me man of the worldly mind replied the ghost do you believe in me or not i do said scrooge i must but why do spirits walk the earth and why do they come to me illustration _to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him _ it is required of every man the ghost returned that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellow men and travel far and wide and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death it is doomed to wander through the world oh woe is me and witness what it cannot share but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness again the spectre raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands you are fettered said scrooge trembling tell me why i wear the chain i forged in life replied the ghost i made it link by link and yard by yard i girded it on of my own free will and of my own free will i wore it is its pattern strange to _you_ scrooge trembled more and more or would you know pursued the ghost the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself it was full as heavy and as long as this seven christmas eves ago you have laboured on it since it is a ponderous chain scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he could see nothing jacob he said imploringly old jacob marley tell me more speak comfort to me jacob i have none to give the ghost replied it comes from other regions ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men nor can i tell you what i would a very little more is all permitted to me i cannot rest i cannot stay i cannot linger anywhere my spirit never walked beyond our counting house mark me in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money changing hole and weary journeys lie before me it was a habit with scrooge whenever he became thoughtful to put his hands in his breeches pockets pondering on what the ghost had said he did so now but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees you must have been very slow about it jacob scrooge observed in a business like manner though with humility and deference slow the ghost repeated seven years dead mused scrooge and travelling all the time the whole time said the ghost no rest no peace incessant torture of remorse you travel fast said scrooge on the wings of the wind replied the ghost you might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years said scrooge the ghost on hearing this set up another cry and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night that the ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance oh captive bound and double ironed cried the phantom not to know that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunities misused yet such was i oh such was i but you were always a good man of business jacob faltered scrooge who now began to apply this to himself business cried the ghost wringing its hands again mankind was my business the common welfare was my business charity mercy forbearance and benevolence were all my business the dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business it held up its chain at arm's length as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief and flung it heavily upon the ground again at this time of the rolling year the spectre said i suffer most why did i walk through crowds of fellow beings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted _me_ scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate and began to quake exceedingly hear me cried the ghost my time is nearly gone i will said scrooge but don't be hard upon me don't be flowery jacob pray how it is that i appear before you in a shape that you can see i may not tell i have sat invisible beside you many and many a day it was not an agreeable idea scrooge shivered and wiped the perspiration from his brow that is no light part of my penance pursued the ghost i am here to night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate a chance and hope of my procuring ebenezer you were always a good friend to me said scrooge thankee you will be haunted resumed the ghost by three spirits scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the ghost's had done is that the chance and hope you mentioned jacob he demanded in a faltering voice it is i i think i'd rather not said scrooge without their visits said the ghost you cannot hope to shun the path i tread expect the first to morrow when the bell tolls one couldn't i take 'em all at once and have it over jacob hinted scrooge expect the second on the next night at the same hour the third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate look to see me no more and look that for your own sake you remember what has passed between us when it had said these words the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound it round its head as before scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage he ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude with its chain wound over and about its arm the apparition walked backward from him and at every step it took the window raised itself a little so that when the spectre reached it it was wide open it beckoned scrooge to approach which he did when they were within two paces of each other marley's ghost held up its hand warning him to come no nearer scrooge stopped not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear for on the raising of the hand he became sensible of confused noises in the air incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self accusatory the spectre after listening for a moment joined in the mournful dirge and floated out upon the bleak dark night scrooge followed to the window desperate in his curiosity he looked out the air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went every one of them wore chains like marley's ghost some few they might be guilty governments were linked together none were free many had been personally known to scrooge in their lives he had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant whom it saw below upon a doorstep the misery with them all was clearly that they sought to interfere for good in human matters and had lost the power for ever whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them he could not tell but they and their spirit voices faded together and the night became as it had been when he walked home scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had entered it was double locked as he had locked it with his own hands and the bolts were undisturbed he tried to say humbug but stopped at the first syllable and being from the emotion he had undergone or the fatigues of the day or his glimpse of the invisible world or the dull conversation of the ghost or the lateness of the hour much in need of repose went straight to bed without undressing and fell asleep upon the instant stave two the first of the three spirits when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber he was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters so he listened for the hour to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven and from seven to eight and regularly up to twelve then stopped twelve it was past two when he went to bed the clock was wrong an icicle must have got into the works twelve he touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock its rapid little pulse beat twelve and stopped why it isn't possible said scrooge that i can have slept through a whole day and far into another night it isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun and this is twelve at noon the idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window he was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing gown before he could see anything and could see very little then all he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold and that there was no noise of people running to and fro and making a great stir as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world this was a great relief because three days after sight of this first of exchange pay to mr ebenezer scrooge or his order and so forth would have become a mere united states security if there were no days to count by scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over and over and could make nothing of it the more he thought the more perplexed he was and the more he endeavoured not to think the more he thought marley's ghost bothered him exceedingly every time he resolved within himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first position and presented the same problem to be worked all through was it a dream or not scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more when he remembered on a sudden that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one he resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed and considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to heaven this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power the quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously and missed the clock at length it broke upon his listening ear ding dong a quarter past said scrooge counting ding dong half past said scrooge ding dong a quarter to it said scrooge ding dong the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else he spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with a deep dull hollow melancholy one light flashed up in the room upon the instant and the curtains of his bed were drawn the curtains of his bed were drawn aside i tell you by a hand not the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his back but those to which his face was addressed the curtains of his bed were drawn aside and scrooge starting up into a half recumbent attitude found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them as close to it as i am now to you and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow it was a strange figure like a child yet not so like a child as like an old man viewed through some supernatural medium which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view and being diminished to a child's proportions its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was white as if with age and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin the arms were very long and muscular the hands the same as if its hold were of uncommon strength its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper members bare it wore a tunic of the purest white and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful it held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer flowers but the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light by which all this was visible and which was doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments a great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under its arm even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness was _not_ its strangest quality for as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another and what was light one instant at another time was dark so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness being now a thing with one arm now with one leg now with twenty legs now a pair of legs without a head now a head without a body of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away and in the very wonder of this it would be itself again distinct and clear as ever are you the spirit sir whose coming was foretold to me asked scrooge i am the voice was soft and gentle singularly low as if instead of being so close beside him it were at a distance who and what are you scrooge demanded i am the ghost of christmas past long past inquired scrooge observant of its dwarfish stature no your past perhaps scrooge could not have told anybody why if anybody could have asked him but he had a special desire to see the spirit in his cap and begged him to be covered what exclaimed the ghost would you so soon put out with worldly hands the light i give is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the spirit at any period of his life he then made bold to inquire what business brought him there your welfare said the ghost scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end the spirit must have heard him thinking for it said immediately your reclamation then take heed it put out its strong hand as it spoke and clasped him gently by the arm rise and walk with me it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below freezing that he was clad but lightly in his slippers dressing gown and nightcap and that he had a cold upon him at that time the grasp though gentle as a woman's hand was not to be resisted he rose but finding that the spirit made towards the window clasped its robe in supplication i am a mortal scrooge remonstrated and liable to fall bear but a touch of my hand _there_ said the spirit laying it upon his heart and you shall be upheld in more than this as the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand the city had entirely vanished not a vestige of it was to be seen the darkness and the mist had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with the snow upon the ground good heaven said scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked about him i was bred in this place i was a boy here the spirit gazed upon him mildly its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old man's sense of feeling he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long forgotten your lip is trembling said the ghost and what is that upon your cheek scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a pimple and begged the ghost to lead him where he would you recollect the way inquired the spirit remember it cried scrooge with fervour i could walk it blindfold strange to have forgotten it for so many years observed the ghost let us go on illustration _ you recollect the way inquired the spirit remember it cried scrooge with fervour i could walk it blindfold _ they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little market town appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers all these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it these are but shadows of the things that have been said the ghost they have no consciousness of us the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named them every one why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas as they parted at cross roads and by ways for their several homes what was merry christmas to scrooge out upon merry christmas what good had it ever done to him the school is not quite deserted said the ghost a solitary child neglected by his friends is left there still scrooge said he knew it and he sobbed they left the high road by a well remembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little weather cock surmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it it was a large house but one of broken fortunes for the spacious offices were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the coach houses and sheds were overrun with grass nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast there was an earthly savour in the air a chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle light and not too much to eat they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house it opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he had used to be not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the half thawed water spout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood why it's ali baba scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy it's dear old honest ali baba yes yes i know one christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he _did_ come for the first time just like that poor boy and valentine said scrooge and his wild brother orson there they go and what's his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus don't you see him and the sultan's groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right i'm glad of it what business had _he_ to be married to the princess to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed illustration _ why it's ali baba scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy it's dear old honest ali baba _ there's the parrot cried scrooge green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island 'poor robin crusoe where have you been robin crusoe ' the man thought he was dreaming but he wasn't it was the parrot you know there goes friday running for his life to the little creek halloa hoop halloo then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character he said in pity for his former self poor boy and cried again i wish scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking about him after drying his eyes with his cuff but it's too late now what is the matter asked the spirit nothing said scrooge nothing there was a boy singing a christmas carol at my door last night i should like to have given him something that's all the ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand saying as it did so let us see another christmas scrooge's former self grew larger at the words and the room became a little darker and more dirty the panels shrunk the windows cracked fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling and the naked laths were shown instead but how all this was brought about scrooge knew no more than you do he only knew that it was quite correct that everything had happened so that there he was alone again when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays he was not reading now but walking up and down despairingly scrooge looked at the ghost and with a mournful shaking of his head glanced anxiously towards the door it opened and a little girl much younger than the boy came darting in and putting her arms about his neck and often kissing him addressed him as her dear dear brother i have come to bring you home dear brother said the child clapping her tiny hands and bending down to laugh to bring you home home home home little fan returned the boy yes said the child brimful of glee home for good and all home for ever and ever father is so much kinder than he used to be that home's like heaven he spoke so gently to me one dear night when i was going to bed that i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home and he said yes you should and sent me in a coach to bring you and you're to be a man said the child opening her eyes and are never to come back here but first we're to be together all the christmas long and have the merriest time in all the world you are quite a woman little fan exclaimed the boy she clapped her hands and laughed and tried to touch his head but being too little laughed again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him then she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the door and he nothing loath to go accompanied her a terrible voice in the hall cried bring down master scrooge's box there and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious condescension and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him he then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour that ever was seen where the maps upon the wall and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows were waxy with cold here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine and a block of curiously heavy cake and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people at the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of something to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before he had rather not master scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise the children bade the schoolmaster good bye right willingly and getting into it drove gaily down the garden sweep the quick wheels dashing the hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray always a delicate creature whom a breath might have withered said the ghost but she had a large heart so she had cried scrooge you're right i will not gainsay it spirit god forbid she died a woman said the ghost and had as i think children one child scrooge returned true said the ghost your nephew scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind and answered briefly yes although they had but that moment left the school behind them they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city where shadowy passengers passed and repassed where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way and all the strife and tumult of a real city were it was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmas time again but it was evening and the streets were lighted up the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked scrooge if he knew it know it said scrooge was i apprenticed here they went in at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great excitement why it's old fezziwig bless his heart it's fezziwig alive again old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice yo ho there ebenezer dick scrooge's former self now grown a young man came briskly in accompanied by his fellow 'prentice dick wilkins to be sure said scrooge to the ghost bless me yes there he is he was very much attached to me was dick poor dick dear dear yo ho my boys said fezziwig no more work to night christmas eve dick christmas ebenezer let's have the shutters up cried old fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands before a man can say jack robinson you wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it they charged into the street with the shutters one two three had 'em up in their places four five six barred 'em and pinned 'em seven eight nine and came back before you could have got to twelve panting like race horses hilli ho cried old fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility clear away my lads and let's have lots of room here hilli ho dick chirrup ebenezer clear away there was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away or couldn't have cleared away with old fezziwig looking on it was done in a minute every movable was packed off as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore the floor was swept and watered the lamps were trimmed fuel was heaped upon the fire and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ball room as you would desire to see upon a winter's night in came a fiddler with a music book and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches in came mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile in came the three miss fezziwigs beaming and lovable in came the six young followers whose hearts they broke in came all the young men and women employed in the business in came the housemaid with her cousin the baker in came the cook with her brother's particular friend the milkman in came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his master trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress in they all came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came any how and every how away they all went twenty couple at once hands half round and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping old top couple always turning up in the wrong place new top couple starting off again as soon as they got there all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help them when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out well done and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose but scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again though there were no dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been carried home exhausted on a shutter and he were a bran new man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were mince pies and plenty of beer but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled when the fiddler an artful dog mind the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him struck up sir roger de coverley then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs fezziwig top couple too with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them three or four and twenty pair of partners people who were not to be trifled with people who _would_ dance and had no notion of walking but if they had been twice as many ah four times old fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would mrs fezziwig as to _her_ she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term if that's not high praise tell me higher and i'll use it a positive light appeared to issue from fezziwig's calves they shone in every part of the dance like moons you couldn't have predicted at any given time what would become of them next and when old fezziwig and mrs fezziwig had gone all through the dance advance and retire both hands to your partner bow and curtsy cork screw thread the needle and back again to your place fezziwig cut cut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without a stagger when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up mr and mrs fezziwig took their stations one on either side the door and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him or her a merry christmas when everybody had retired but the two 'prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their beds which were under a counter in the back shop during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self he corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation it was not until now when the bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its head burnt very clear a small matter said the ghost to make these silly folks so full of gratitude small echoed scrooge the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig and when he had done so said why is it not he has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money three or four perhaps is that so much that he deserves this praise it isn't that said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self it isn't that spirit he has the power to render us happy or unhappy to make our service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil say that his power lies in words and looks in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count 'em up what then the happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune he felt the spirit's glance and stopped what is the matter asked the ghost nothing particular said scrooge something i think the ghost insisted no said scrooge no i should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now that's all his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by side in the open air my time grows short observed the spirit quick this was not addressed to scrooge or to any one whom he could see but it produced an immediate effect for again scrooge saw himself he was older now a man in the prime of life his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice there was an eager greedy restless motion in the eye which showed the passion that had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall he was not alone but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning dress in whose eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of christmas past it matters little she said softly to you very little another idol has displaced me and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come as i would have tried to do i have no just cause to grieve what idol has displaced you he rejoined a golden one this is the even handed dealing of the world he said there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth you fear the world too much she answered gently all your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach i have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one until the master passion gain engrosses you have i not what then he retorted even if i have grown so much wiser what then i am not changed towards you she shook her head am i our contract is an old one it was made when we were both poor and content to be so until in good season we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry you _are_ changed when it was made you were another man i was a boy he said impatiently your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are she returned i am that which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two how often and how keenly i have thought of this i will not say it is enough that i _have_ thought of it and can release you have i ever sought release in words no never in what then in a changed nature in an altered spirit in another atmosphere of life another hope as its great end in everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight if this had never been between us said the girl looking mildly but with steadiness upon him tell me would you seek me out and try to win me now ah no he seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of himself but he said with a struggle you think not i would gladly think otherwise if i could she answered heaven knows when _i_ have learned a truth like this i know how strong and irresistible it must be but if you were free to day to morrow yesterday can even i believe that you would choose a dowerless girl you who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by gain or choosing her if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so do i not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow i do and i release you with a full heart for the love of him you once were he was about to speak but with her head turned from him she resumed you may the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will have pain in this a very very brief time and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream from which it happened well that you awoke may you be happy in the life you have chosen she left him and they parted spirit said scrooge show me no more conduct me home why do you delight to torture me one shadow more exclaimed the ghost no more cried scrooge no more i don't wish to see it show me no more but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened next they were in another scene and place a room not very large or handsome but full of comfort near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same until he saw _her_ now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more children there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting itself like forty the consequences were uproarious beyond belief but no one seemed to care on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed heartily and enjoyed it very much and the latter soon beginning to mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly what would i not have given to be one of them though i never could have been so rude no no i wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down and for the precious little shoe i wouldn't have plucked it off god bless my soul to save my life as to measuring her waist in sport as they did bold young brood i couldn't have done it i should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment and never come straight again and yet i should have dearly liked i own to have touched her lips to have questioned her that she might have opened them to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised a blush to have let loose waves of hair an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price in short i should have liked i do confess to have had the lightest licence of a child and yet to have been man enough to know its value but now a knocking at the door was heard and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it in the centre of a flushed and boisterous group just in time to greet the father who came home attended by a man laden with christmas toys and presents then the shouting and the struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter the scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets despoil him of brown paper parcels hold on tight by his cravat hug him round the neck pummel his back and kick his legs in irrepressible affection the shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received the terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a wooden platter the immense relief of finding this a false alarm the joy and gratitude and ecstasy they are all indescribable alike it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour and by one stair at a time up to the top of the house where they went to bed and so subsided and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of the house having his daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside and when he thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have called him father and been a spring time in the haggard winter of his life his sight grew very dim indeed belle said the husband turning to his wife with a smile i saw an old friend of yours this afternoon who was it guess how can i tut don't i know she added in the same breath laughing as he laughed mr scrooge mr scrooge it was i passed his office window and as it was not shut up and he had a candle inside i could scarcely help seeing him his partner lies upon the point of death i hear and there he sat alone quite alone in the world i do believe spirit said scrooge in a broken voice remove me from this place i told you these were shadows of the things that have been said the ghost that they are what they are do not blame me remove me scrooge exclaimed i cannot bear it he turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a face in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him wrestled with it leave me take me back haunt me no longer in the struggle if that can be called a struggle in which the ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright and dimly connecting that with its influence over him he seized the extinguisher cap and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head the spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its whole form but though scrooge pressed it down with all his force he could not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken flood upon the ground he was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness and further of being in his own bedroom he gave the cap a parting squeeze in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep\"),\n",

had but newly retired from the face of the earth and it would not be wonderful to meet a megalosaurus forty feet long or so waddling like an elephantine lizard up holborn hill smoke lowering down from chimney pots making a soft black drizzle with flakes of soot in it as big as full grown snowflakes gone into mourning one might imagine for the death of the sun dogs undistinguishable in mire horses scarcely better splashed to their very blinkers foot passengers jostling one another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper and losing their foot hold at street corners where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke if this day ever broke adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement and accumulating at compound interest fog everywhere fog up the river where it flows among green aits and meadows fog down the river where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great and dirty city fog on the essex marshes fog on the kentish heights fog creeping into the cabooses of collier brigs fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats fog in the eyes and throats of ancient greenwich pensioners wheezing by the firesides of their wards fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper down in his close cabin fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little 'prentice boy on deck chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog with fog all round them as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds gas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets much as the sun may from the spongey fields be seen to loom by husbandman and ploughboy most of the shops lighted two hours before their time as the gas seems to know for it has a haggard and unwilling look the raw afternoon is rawest and the dense fog is densest and the muddy streets are muddiest near that leaden headed old obstruction appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden headed old corporation temple bar and hard by temple bar in lincoln's inn hall at the very heart of the fog sits the lord high chancellor in his high court of chancery never can there come fog too thick never can there come mud and mire too deep to assort with the groping and floundering condition which this high court of chancery most pestilent of hoary sinners holds this day in the sight of heaven and earth on such an afternoon if ever the lord high chancellor ought to be sitting here as here he is with a foggy glory round his head softly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains addressed by a large advocate with great whiskers a little voice and an interminable brief and outwardly directing his contemplation to the lantern in the roof where he can see nothing but fog on such an afternoon some score of members of the high court of chancery bar ought to be as here they are mistily engaged in one of the ten thousand stages of an endless cause tripping one another up on slippery precedents groping knee deep in technicalities running their goat hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and making a pretence of equity with serious faces as players might on such an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause some two or three of whom have inherited it from their fathers who made a fortune by it ought to be as are they not ranged in a line in a long matted well but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom of it between the registrar's red table and the silk gowns with bills cross bills answers rejoinders injunctions affidavits issues references to masters masters' reports mountains of costly nonsense piled before them well may the court be dim with wasting candles here and there well may the fog hang heavy in it as if it would never get out well may the stained glass windows lose their colour and admit no light of day into the place well may the uninitiated from the streets who peep in through the glass panes in the door be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the drawl languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the lord high chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it and where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog bank this is the court of chancery which has its decaying houses and its blighted lands in every shire which has its worn out lunatic in every madhouse and its dead in every churchyard which has its ruined suitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and begging through the round of every man's acquaintance which gives to monied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right which so exhausts finances patience courage hope so overthrows the brain and breaks the heart that there is not an honourable man among its practitioners who would not give who does not often give the warning suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come here who happen to be in the lord chancellor's court this murky afternoon besides the lord chancellor the counsel in the cause two or three counsel who are never in any cause and the well of solicitors before mentioned there is the registrar below the judge in wig and gown and there are two or three maces or petty bags or privy purses or whatever they may be in legal court suits these are all yawning for no crumb of amusement ever falls from jarndyce and jarndyce the cause in hand which was squeezed dry years upon years ago the short hand writers the reporters of the court and the reporters of the newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when jarndyce and jarndyce comes on their places are a blank standing on a seat at the side of the hall the better to peer into the curtained sanctuary is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is always in court from its sitting to its rising and always expecting some incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour some say she really is or was a party to a suit but no one knows for certain because no one cares she carries some small litter in a reticule which she calls her documents principally consisting of paper matches and dry lavender a sallow prisoner has come up in custody for the half dozenth time to make a personal application to purge himself of his contempt which being a solitary surviving executor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts of which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge he is not at all likely ever to do in the meantime his prospects in life are ended another ruined suitor who periodically appears from shropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the chancellor at the close of the day's business and who can by no means be made to understand that the chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence after making it desolate for a quarter of a century plants himself in a good place and keeps an eye on the judge ready to call out my lord in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising a few lawyers' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger on the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal weather a little jarndyce and jarndyce drones on this scarecrow of a suit has in course of time become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means the parties to it understand it least but it has been observed that no two chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises innumerable children have been born into the cause innumerable young people have married into it innumerable old people have died out of it scores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in jarndyce and jarndyce without knowing how or why whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the suit the little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new rocking horse when jarndyce and jarndyce should be settled has grown up possessed himself of a real horse and trotted away into the other world fair wards of court have faded into mothers and grandmothers a long procession of chancellors has come in and gone out the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere bills of mortality there are not three jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps since old tom jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffee house in chancery lane but jarndyce and jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the court perennially hopeless jarndyce and jarndyce has passed into a joke that is the only good that has ever come of it it has been death to many but it is a joke in the profession every master in chancery has had a reference out of it every chancellor was in it for somebody or other when he was counsel at the bar good things have been said about it by blue nosed bulbous shoed old benchers in select port wine committee after dinner in hall articled clerks have been in the habit of fleshing their legal wit upon it the last lord chancellor handled it neatly when correcting mr blowers the eminent silk gown who said that such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes he observed or when we get through jarndyce and jarndyce mr blowers a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces bags and purses how many people out of the suit jarndyce and jarndyce has stretched forth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide question from the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty warrants in jarndyce and jarndyce have grimly writhed into many shapes down to the copying clerk in the six clerks' office who has copied his tens of thousands of chancery folio pages under that eternal heading no man's nature has been made better by it in trickery evasion procrastination spoliation botheration under false pretences of all sorts there are influences that can never come to good the very solicitors' boys who have kept the wretched suitors at bay by protesting time out of mind that mr chizzle mizzle or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments until dinner may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into themselves out of jarndyce and jarndyce the receiver in the cause has acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a distrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind chizzle mizzle and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising themselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter and see what can be done for drizzle who was not well used when jarndyce and jarndyce shall be got out of the office shirking and sharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the ill fated cause and even those who have contemplated its history from the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some off hand manner never meant to go right thus in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog sits the lord high chancellor in his high court of chancery mr tangle says the lord high chancellor latterly something restless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman mlud says mr tangle mr tangle knows more of jarndyce and jarndyce than anybody he is famous for it supposed never to have read anything else since he left school have you nearly concluded your argument mlud no variety of points feel it my duty tsubmit ludship is the reply that slides out of mr tangle several members of the bar are still to be heard i believe says the chancellor with a slight smile eighteen of mr tangle's learned friends each armed with a little summary of eighteen hundred sheets bob up like eighteen hammers in a pianoforte make eighteen bows and drop into their eighteen places of obscurity we will proceed with the hearing on wednesday fortnight says the chancellor for the question at issue is only a question of costs a mere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit and really will come to a settlement one of these days the chancellor rises the bar rises the prisoner is brought forward in a hurry the man from shropshire cries my lord maces bags and purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from shropshire in reference proceeds the chancellor still on jarndyce and jarndyce to the young girl begludship's pardon boy says mr tangle prematurely in reference proceeds the chancellor with extra distinctness to the young girl and boy the two young people mr tangle crushed whom i directed to be in attendance to day and who are now in my private room i will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of making the order for their residing with their uncle mr tangle on his legs again begludship's pardon dead with their chancellor looking through his double eye glass at the papers on his desk grandfather begludship's pardon victim of rash action brains suddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises fully inflated in the back settlements of the fog and says will your lordship allow me i appear for him he is a cousin several times removed i am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in what exact remove he is a cousin but he is a cousin leaving this address delivered like a sepulchral message ringing in the rafters of the roof the very little counsel drops and the fog knows him no more everybody looks for him nobody can see him i will speak with both the young people says the chancellor anew and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their cousin i will mention the matter to morrow morning when i take my seat the chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is presented nothing can possibly come of the prisoner's conglomeration but his being sent back to prison which is soon done the man from shropshire ventures another remonstrative my lord but the chancellor being aware of him has dexterously vanished everybody else quickly vanishes too a battery of blue bags is loaded with heavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks the little mad old woman marches off with her documents the empty court is locked up if all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has caused could only be locked up with it and the whole burnt away in a great funeral pyre why so much the better for other parties than the parties in jarndyce and jarndyce ii in fashion it is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same miry afternoon it is not so unlike the court of chancery but that we may pass from the one scene to the other as the crow flies both the world of fashion and the court of chancery are things of precedent and usage oversleeping rip van winkles who have played at strange games through a deal of thundery weather sleeping beauties whom the knight will wake one day when all the stopped spits in the kitchen shall begin to turn prodigiously it is not a large world relatively even to this world of ours which has its limits too as your highness shall find when you have made the tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond it is a very little speck there is much good in it there are many good and true people in it it has its appointed place but the evil of it is that it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller's cotton and fine wool and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds and cannot see them as they circle round the sun it is a deadened world and its growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air my lady dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days previous to her departure for paris where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks after which her movements are uncertain the fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the parisians and it knows all fashionable things to know things otherwise were to be unfashionable my lady dedlock has been down at what she calls in familiar conversation her place in lincolnshire the waters are out in lincolnshire an arch of the bridge in the park has been sapped and sopped away the adjacent low lying ground for half a mile in breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in it and a surface punctured all over all day long with falling rain my lady dedlock's place has been extremely dreary the weather for many a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through and the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman's axe can make no crash or crackle as they fall the deer looking soaked leave quagmires where they pass the shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in the moist air and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards the green rise coppice topped that makes a background for the falling rain the view from my lady dedlock's own windows is alternately a lead coloured view and a view in indian ink the vases on the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day and the heavy drops fall drip drip drip upon the broad flagged pavement called from old time the ghost's walk all night on sundays the little church in the park is mouldy the oaken pulpit breaks out into a cold sweat and there is a general smell and taste as of the ancient dedlocks in their graves my lady dedlock who is childless looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a keeper's lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed panes and smoke rising from the chimney and a child chased by a woman running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a wrapped up man coming through the gate has been put quite out of temper my lady dedlock says she has been bored to death therefore my lady dedlock has come away from the place in lincolnshire and has left it to the rain and the crows and the rabbits and the deer and the partridges and pheasants the pictures of the dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp walls in mere lowness of spirits as the housekeeper has passed along the old rooms shutting up the shutters and when they will next come forth again the fashionable intelligence which like the fiend is omniscient of the past and present but not the future cannot yet undertake to say sir leicester dedlock is only a baronet but there is no mightier baronet than he his family is as old as the hills and infinitely more respectable he has a general opinion that the world might get on without hills but would be done up without dedlocks he would on the whole admit nature to be a good idea a little low perhaps when not enclosed with a park fence but an idea dependent for its execution on your great county families he is a gentleman of strict conscience disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on the shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather than give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity he is an honourable obstinate truthful high spirited intensely prejudiced perfectly unreasonable man sir leicester is twenty years full measure older than my lady he will never see sixty five again nor perhaps sixty six nor yet sixty seven he has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a little stiffly he is of a worthy presence with his light grey hair and whiskers his fine shirt frill his pure white waistcoat and his blue coat with bright buttons always buttoned he is ceremonious stately most polite on every occasion to my lady and holds her personal attractions in the highest estimation his gallantry to my lady which has never changed since he courted her is the one little touch of romantic fancy in him indeed he married her for love a whisper still goes about that she had not even family howbeit sir leicester had so much family that perhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more but she had beauty pride ambition insolent resolve and sense enough to portion out a legion of fine ladies wealth and station added to these soon floated her upward and for years now my lady dedlock has been at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of the fashionable tree how alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer everybody knows or has some reason to know by this time the matter having been rather frequently mentioned my lady dedlock having conquered her world fell not into the melting but rather into the freezing mood an exhausted composure a worn out placidity an equanimity of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction are the trophies of her victory she is perfectly well bred if she could be translated to heaven to morrow she might be expected to ascend without any rapture she has beauty still and if it be not in its heyday it is not yet in its autumn she has a fine face originally of a character that would be rather called very pretty than handsome but improved into classicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state her figure is elegant and has the effect of being tall not that she is so but that the most is made as the honourable bob stables has frequently asserted upon oath of all her points the same authority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in commendation of her hair especially that she is the best groomed woman in the whole stud with all her perfections on her head my lady dedlock has come up from her place in lincolnshire hotly pursued by the fashionable intelligence to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her departure for paris where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks after which her movements are uncertain and at her house in town upon this muddy murky afternoon presents himself an old fashioned old gentleman attorney at law and eke solicitor of the high court of chancery who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the dedlocks and has as many cast iron boxes in his office with that name outside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror's trick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set across the hall and up the stairs and along the passages and through the rooms which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of it fairy land to visit but a desert to live in the old gentleman is conducted by a mercury in powder to my lady's presence the old gentleman is rusty to look at but is reputed to have made good thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic wills and to be very rich he is surrounded by a mysterious halo of family confidences of which he is known to be the silent depository there are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of parks among the growing timber and the fern which perhaps hold fewer noble secrets than walk abroad among men shut up in the breast of mr tulkinghorn he is of what is called the old school a phrase generally meaning any school that seems never to have been young and wears knee breeches tied with ribbons and gaiters or stockings one peculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings be they silk or worsted is that they never shine mute close irresponsive to any glancing light his dress is like himself he never converses when not professionally consulted he is found sometimes speechless but quite at home at corners of dinner tables in great country houses and near doors of drawing rooms concerning which the fashionable intelligence is eloquent where everybody knows him and where half the peerage stops to say how do you do mr tulkinghorn he receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with the rest of his knowledge sir leicester dedlock is with my lady and is happy to see mr tulkinghorn there is an air of prescription about him which is always agreeable to sir leicester he receives it as a kind of tribute he likes mr tulkinghorn's dress there is a kind of tribute in that too it is eminently respectable and likewise in a general way retainer like it expresses as it were the steward of the legal mysteries the butler of the legal cellar of the dedlocks has mr tulkinghorn any idea of this himself it may be so or it may not but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in everything associated with my lady dedlock as one of a class as one of the leaders and representatives of her little world she supposes herself to be an inscrutable being quite out of the reach and ken of ordinary mortals seeing herself in her glass where indeed she looks so yet every dim little star revolving about her from her maid to the manager of the italian opera knows her weaknesses prejudices follies haughtinesses and caprices and lives upon as accurate a calculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her dressmaker takes of her physical proportions is a new dress a new custom a new singer a new dancer a new form of jewellery a new dwarf or giant a new chapel a new anything to be set up there are deferential people in a dozen callings whom my lady dedlock suspects of nothing but prostration before her who can tell you how to manage her as if she were a baby who do nothing but nurse her all their lives who humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience lead her and her whole troop after them who in hooking one hook all and bear them off as lemuel gulliver bore away the stately fleet of the majestic lilliput if you want to address our people sir say blaze and sparkle the jewellers meaning by our people lady dedlock and the rest you must remember that you are not dealing with the general public you must hit our people in their weakest place and their weakest place is such a place to make this article go down gentlemen say sheen and gloss the mercers to their friends the manufacturers you must come to us because we know where to have the fashionable people and we can make it fashionable if you want to get this print upon the tables of my high connexion sir says mr sladdery the librarian or if you want to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion sir or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of my high connexion sir you must leave it if you please to me for i have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion sir and i may tell you without vanity that i can turn them round my finger in which mr sladdery who is an honest man does not exaggerate at all therefore while mr tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the dedlock mind at present it is very possible that he may my lady's cause has been again before the chancellor has it mr tulkinghorn says sir leicester giving him his hand yes it has been on again to day mr tulkinghorn replies making one of his quiet bows to my lady who is on a sofa near the fire shading her face with a hand screen it would be useless to ask says my lady with the dreariness of the place in lincolnshire still upon her whether anything has been done nothing that you would call anything has been done to day replies mr tulkinghorn nor ever will be says my lady sir leicester has no objection to an interminable chancery suit it is a slow expensive british constitutional kind of thing to be sure he has not a vital interest in the suit in question her part in which was the only property my lady brought him and he has a shadowy impression that for his name the name of dedlock to be in a cause and not in the title of that cause is a most ridiculous accident but he regards the court of chancery even if it should involve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of confusion as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of other somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal settlement humanly speaking of everything and he is upon the whole of a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to any complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the lower classes to rise up somewhere like wat tyler as a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file says mr tulkinghorn and as they are short and as i proceed upon the troublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any new proceedings in a cause cautious man mr tulkinghorn taking no more responsibility than necessary and further as i see you are going to paris i have brought them in my pocket sir leicester was going to paris too by the by but the delight of the fashionable intelligence was in his lady mr tulkinghorn takes out his papers asks permission to place them on a golden talisman of a table at my lady's elbow puts on his spectacles and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp 'in chancery between john jarndyce ' my lady interrupts requesting him to miss as many of the formal horrors as he can mr tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower down my lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention sir leicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a stately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging among the national bulwarks it happens that the fire is hot where my lady sits and that the hand screen is more beautiful than useful being priceless but small my lady changing her position sees the papers on the table looks at them nearer looks at them nearer still asks impulsively who copied that mr tulkinghorn stops short surprised by my lady's animation and her unusual tone is it what you people call law hand she asks looking full at him in her careless way again and toying with her screen not quite probably mr tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks the legal

       "  'david copperfield the personal history and experience of david copperfield the younger i am born whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that station will be held by anybody else these pages must show to begin my life with the beginning of my life i record that i was born as i have been informed and believe on a friday at twelve o’clock at night it was remarked that the clock began to strike and i began to cry simultaneously in consideration of the day and hour of my birth it was declared by the nurse and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted first that i was destined to be unlucky in life and secondly that i was privileged to see ghosts and spirits both these gifts inevitably attaching as they believed to all unlucky infants of either gender born towards the small hours on a friday night i need say nothing here on the first head because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result on the second branch of the question i will only remark that unless i ran through that part of my inheritance while i was still a baby i have not come into it yet but i do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it he is heartily welcome to keep it i was born with a caul which was advertised for sale in the newspapers at the low price of fifteen guineas whether sea going people were short of money about that time or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets i don’t know all i know is that there was but one solitary bidding and that was from an attorney connected with the bill broking business who offered two pounds in cash and the balance in sherry but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss for as to sherry my poor dear mother’s own sherry was in the market then and ten years afterwards the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country to fifty members at half a crown a head the winner to spend five shillings i was present myself and i remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused at a part of myself being disposed of in that way the caul was won i recollect by an old lady with a hand basket who very reluctantly produced from it the stipulated five shillings all in halfpence and twopence halfpenny short as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic to endeavour without any effect to prove to her it is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there that she was never drowned but died triumphantly in bed at ninety two i have understood that it was to the last her proudest boast that she never had been on the water in her life except upon a bridge and that over her tea to which she was extremely partial she to the last expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others who had the presumption to go ‘meandering’ about the world it was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences tea perhaps included resulted from this objectionable practice she always returned with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection ‘let us have no meandering ’ not to meander myself at present i will go back to my birth i was born at blunderstone in suffolk or ‘there by’ as they say in scotland i was a posthumous child my father’s eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months when mine opened on it there is something strange to me even now in the reflection that he never saw me and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that i have of my first childish associations with his white grave stone in the churchyard and of the indefinable compassion i used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle and the doors of our house were almost cruelly it seemed to me sometimes bolted and locked against it an aunt of my father’s and consequently a great aunt of mine of whom i shall have more to relate by and by was the principal magnate of our family miss trotwood or miss betsey as my poor mother always called her when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all which was seldom had been married to a husband younger than herself who was very handsome except in the sense of the homely adage ‘handsome is that handsome does’ for he was strongly suspected of having beaten miss betsey and even of having once on a disputed question of supplies made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs’ window these evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced miss betsey to pay him off and effect a separation by mutual consent he went to india with his capital and there according to a wild legend in our family he was once seen riding on an elephant in company with a baboon but i think it must have been a baboo or a begum anyhow from india tidings of his death reached home within ten years how they affected my aunt nobody knew for immediately upon the separation she took her maiden name again bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea coast a long way off established herself there as a single woman with one servant and was understood to live secluded ever afterwards in an inflexible retirement my father had once been a favourite of hers i believe but she was mortally affronted by his marriage on the ground that my mother was ‘a wax doll’ she had never seen my mother but she knew her to be not yet twenty my father and miss betsey never met again he was double my mother’s age when he married and of but a delicate constitution he died a year afterwards and as i have said six months before i came into the world this was the state of matters on the afternoon of what i may be excused for calling that eventful and important friday i can make no claim therefore to have known at that time how matters stood or to have any remembrance founded on the evidence of my own senses of what follows my mother was sitting by the fire but poorly in health and very low in spirits looking at it through her tears and desponding heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger who was already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins in a drawer upstairs to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival my mother i say was sitting by the fire that bright windy march afternoon very timid and sad and very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her when lifting her eyes as she dried them to the window opposite she saw a strange lady coming up the garden my mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance that it was miss betsey the setting sun was glowing on the strange lady over the garden fence and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else when she reached the house she gave another proof of her identity my father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary christian and now instead of ringing the bell she came and looked in at that identical window pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment she gave my mother such a turn that i have always been convinced i am indebted to miss betsey for having been born on a friday my mother had left her chair in her agitation and gone behind it in the corner miss betsey looking round the room slowly and inquiringly began on the other side and carried her eyes on like a saracen’s head in a dutch clock until they reached my mother then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother like one who was accustomed to be obeyed to come and open the door my mother went ‘mrs david copperfield i think ’ said miss betsey the emphasis referring perhaps to my mother’s mourning weeds and her condition ‘yes ’ said my mother faintly ‘miss trotwood ’ said the visitor ‘you have heard of her i dare say ’ my mother answered she had had that pleasure and she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure ‘now you see her ’ said miss betsey my mother bent her head and begged her to walk in they went into the parlour my mother had come from the fire in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted not having been lighted indeed since my father’s funeral and when they were both seated and miss betsey said nothing my mother after vainly trying to restrain herself began to cry ‘oh tut tut tut ’ said miss betsey in a hurry ‘don’t do that come come ’ my mother couldn’t help it notwithstanding so she cried until she had had her cry out ‘take off your cap child ’ said miss betsey ‘and let me see you ’ my mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request if she had any disposition to do so therefore she did as she was told and did it with such nervous hands that her hair which was luxuriant and beautiful fell all about her face ‘why bless my heart ’ exclaimed miss betsey ‘you are a very baby ’ my mother was no doubt unusually youthful in appearance even for her years she hung her head as if it were her fault poor thing and said sobbing that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow and would be but a childish mother if she lived in a short pause which ensued she had a fancy that she felt miss betsey touch her hair and that with no ungentle hand but looking at her in her timid hope she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up her hands folded on one knee and her feet upon the fender frowning at the fire ‘in the name of heaven ’ said miss betsey suddenly ‘why rookery ’ ‘do you mean the house ma’am ’ asked my mother ‘why rookery ’ said miss betsey ‘cookery would have been more to the purpose if you had had any practical ideas of life either of you ’ ‘the name was mr copperfield’s choice ’ returned my mother ‘when he bought the house he liked to think that there were rooks about it ’ the evening wind made such a disturbance just now among some tall old elm trees at the bottom of the garden that neither my mother nor miss betsey could forbear glancing that way as the elms bent to one another like giants who were whispering secrets and after a few seconds of such repose fell into a violent flurry tossing their wild arms about as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks’ nests burdening their higher branches swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea ‘where are the birds ’ asked miss betsey ‘the ’ my mother had been thinking of something else ‘the rooks what has become of them ’ asked miss betsey ‘there have not been any since we have lived here ’ said my mother ‘we thought mr copperfield thought it was quite a large rookery but the nests were very old ones and the birds have deserted them a long while ’ ‘david copperfield all over ’ cried miss betsey ‘david copperfield from head to foot calls a house a rookery when there’s not a rook near it and takes the birds on trust because he sees the nests ’ ‘mr copperfield ’ returned my mother ‘is dead and if you dare to speak unkindly of him to me ’ my poor dear mother i suppose had some momentary intention of committing an assault and battery upon my aunt who could easily have settled her with one hand even if my mother had been in far better training for such an encounter than she was that evening but it passed with the action of rising from her chair and she sat down again very meekly and fainted when she came to herself or when miss betsey had restored her whichever it was she found the latter standing at the window the twilight was by this time shading down into darkness and dimly as they saw each other they could not have done that without the aid of the fire ‘well ’ said miss betsey coming back to her chair as if she had only been taking a casual look at the prospect ‘and when do you expect ’ ‘i am all in a tremble ’ faltered my mother ‘i don’t know what’s the matter i shall die i am sure ’ ‘no no no ’ said miss betsey ‘have some tea ’ ‘oh dear me dear me do you think it will do me any good ’ cried my mother in a helpless manner ‘of course it will ’ said miss betsey ‘it’s nothing but fancy what do you call your girl ’ ‘i don’t know that it will be a girl yet ma’am ’ said my mother innocently ‘bless the baby ’ exclaimed miss betsey unconsciously quoting the second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs but applying it to my mother instead of me ‘i don’t mean that i mean your servant girl ’ ‘peggotty ’ said my mother ‘peggotty ’ repeated miss betsey with some indignation ‘do you mean to say child that any human being has gone into a christian church and got herself named peggotty ’ ‘it’s her surname ’ said my mother faintly ‘mr copperfield called her by it because her christian name was the same as mine ’ ‘here peggotty ’ cried miss betsey opening the parlour door ‘tea your mistress is a little unwell don’t dawdle ’ having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house and having looked out to confront the amazed peggotty coming along the passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice miss betsey shut the door again and sat down as before with her feet on the fender the skirt of her dress tucked up and her hands folded on one knee ‘you were speaking about its being a girl ’ said miss betsey ‘i have no doubt it will be a girl i have a presentiment that it must be a girl now child from the moment of the birth of this girl ’ ‘perhaps boy ’ my mother took the liberty of putting in ‘i tell you i have a presentiment that it must be a girl ’ returned miss betsey ‘don’t contradict from the moment of this girl’s birth child i intend to be her friend i intend to be her godmother and i beg you’ll call her betsey trotwood copperfield there must be no mistakes in life with this betsey trotwood there must be no trifling with her affections poor dear she must be well brought up and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved i must make that my care ’ there was a twitch of miss betsey’s head after each of these sentences as if her own old wrongs were working within her and she repressed any plainer reference to them by strong constraint so my mother suspected at least as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire too much scared by miss betsey too uneasy in herself and too subdued and bewildered altogether to observe anything very clearly or to know what to say ‘and was david good to you child ’ asked miss betsey when she had been silent for a little while and these motions of her head had gradually ceased ‘were you comfortable together ’ ‘we were very happy ’ said my mother ‘mr copperfield was only too good to me ’ ‘what he spoilt you i suppose ’ returned miss betsey ‘for being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world again yes i fear he did indeed ’ sobbed my mother ‘well don’t cry ’ said miss betsey ‘you were not equally matched child if any two people can be equally matched and so i asked the question you were an orphan weren’t you ’ ‘yes ’ ‘and a governess ’ ‘i was nursery governess in a family where mr copperfield came to visit mr copperfield was very kind to me and took a great deal of notice of me and paid me a good deal of attention and at last proposed to me and i accepted him and so we were married ’ said my mother simply ‘ha poor baby ’ mused miss betsey with her frown still bent upon the fire ‘do you know anything ’ ‘i beg your pardon ma’am ’ faltered my mother ‘about keeping house for instance ’ said miss betsey ‘not much i fear ’ returned my mother ‘not so much as i could wish but mr copperfield was teaching me ’ ‘much he knew about it himself ’ said miss betsey in a parenthesis ‘and i hope i should have improved being very anxious to learn and he very patient to teach me if the great misfortune of his death’ my mother broke down again here and could get no farther ‘well well ’ said miss betsey ‘i kept my housekeeping book regularly and balanced it with mr copperfield every night ’ cried my mother in another burst of distress and breaking down again ‘well well ’ said miss betsey ‘don’t cry any more ’ ‘and i am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it except when mr copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each other or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines ’ resumed my mother in another burst and breaking down again ‘you’ll make yourself ill ’ said miss betsey ‘and you know that will not be good either for you or for my god daughter come you mustn’t do it ’ this argument had some share in quieting my mother though her increasing indisposition had a larger one there was an interval of silence only broken by miss betsey’s occasionally ejaculating ‘ha ’ as she sat with her feet upon the fender ‘david had bought an annuity for himself with his money i know ’ said she by and by ‘what did he do for you ’ ‘mr copperfield ’ said my mother answering with some difficulty ‘was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me ’ ‘how much ’ asked miss betsey ‘a hundred and five pounds a year ’ said my mother ‘he might have done worse ’ said my aunt the word was appropriate to the moment my mother was so much worse that peggotty coming in with the teaboard and candles and seeing at a glance how ill she was as miss betsey might have done sooner if there had been light enough conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all speed and immediately dispatched ham peggotty her nephew who had been for some days past secreted in the house unknown to my mother as a special messenger in case of emergency to fetch the nurse and doctor those allied powers were considerably astonished when they arrived within a few minutes of each other to find an unknown lady of portentous appearance sitting before the fire with her bonnet tied over her left arm stopping her ears with jewellers’ cotton peggotty knowing nothing about her and my mother saying nothing about her she was quite a mystery in the parlour and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers’ cotton in her pocket and sticking the article in her ears in that way did not detract from the solemnity of her presence the doctor having been upstairs and come down again and having satisfied himself i suppose that there was a probability of this unknown lady and himself having to sit there face to face for some hours laid himself out to be polite and social he was the meekest of his sex the mildest of little men he sidled in and out of a room to take up the less space he walked as softly as the ghost in hamlet and more slowly he carried his head on one side partly in modest depreciation of himself partly in modest propitiation of everybody else it is nothing to say that he hadn’t a word to throw at a dog he couldn’t have thrown a word at a mad dog he might have offered him one gently or half a one or a fragment of one for he spoke as slowly as he walked but he wouldn’t have been rude to him and he couldn’t have been quick with him for any earthly consideration mr chillip looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side and making her a little bow said in allusion to the jewellers’ cotton as he softly touched his left ear ‘some local irritation ma’am ’ ‘what ’ replied my aunt pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork mr chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness as he told my mother afterwards that it was a mercy he didn’t lose his presence of mind but he repeated sweetly ‘some local irritation ma’am ’ ‘nonsense ’ replied my aunt and corked herself again at one blow mr chillip could do nothing after this but sit and look at her feebly as she sat and looked at the fire until he was called upstairs again after some quarter of an hour’s absence he returned ‘well ’ said my aunt taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him ‘well ma’am ’ returned mr chillip ‘we are we are progressing slowly ma’am ’ ‘ba a ah ’ said my aunt with a perfect shake on the contemptuous interjection and corked herself as before really really as mr chillip told my mother he was almost shocked speaking in a professional point of view alone he was almost shocked but he sat and looked at her notwithstanding for nearly two hours as she sat looking at the fire until he was again called out after another absence he again returned ‘well ’ said my aunt taking out the cotton on that side again ‘well ma’am ’ returned mr chillip ‘we are we are progressing slowly ma’am ’ ‘ya a ah ’ said my aunt with such a snarl at him that mr chillip absolutely could not bear it it was really calculated to break his spirit he said afterwards he preferred to go and sit upon the stairs in the dark and a strong draught until he was again sent for ham peggotty who went to the national school and was a very dragon at his catechism and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness reported next day that happening to peep in at the parlour door an hour after this he was instantly descried by miss betsey then walking to and fro in a state of agitation and pounced upon before he could make his escape that there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude from the circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest that marching him constantly up and down by the collar as if he had been taking too much laudanum she at those times shook him rumpled his hair made light of his linen stopped his ears as if she confounded them with her own and otherwise tousled and maltreated him this was in part confirmed by his aunt who saw him at half past twelve o’clock soon after his release and affirmed that he was then as red as i was the mild mr chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time if at any time he sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty and said to my aunt in his meekest manner ‘well ma’am i am happy to congratulate you ’ ‘what upon ’ said my aunt sharply mr chillip was fluttered again by the extreme severity of my aunt’s manner so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile to mollify her ‘mercy on the man what’s he doing ’ cried my aunt impatiently ‘can’t he speak ’ ‘be calm my dear ma’am ’ said mr chillip in his softest accents ‘there is no longer any occasion for uneasiness ma’am be calm ’ it has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn’t shake him and shake what he had to say out of him she only shook her own head at him but in a way that made him quail ‘well ma’am ’ resumed mr chillip as soon as he had courage ‘i am happy to congratulate you all is now over ma’am and well over ’ during the five minutes or so that mr chillip devoted to the delivery of this oration my aunt eyed him narrowly ‘how is she ’ said my aunt folding her arms with her bonnet still tied on one of them ‘well ma’am she will soon be quite comfortable i hope ’ returned mr chillip ‘quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be under these melancholy domestic circumstances there cannot be any objection to your seeing her presently ma’am it may do her good ’ ‘and she how is she ’ said my aunt sharply mr chillip laid his head a little more on one side and looked at my aunt like an amiable bird ‘the baby ’ said my aunt ‘how is she ’ ‘ma’am ’ returned mr chillip ‘i apprehended you had known it’s a boy ’ my aunt said never a word but took her bonnet by the strings in the manner of a sling aimed a blow at mr chillip’s head with it put it on bent walked out and never came back she vanished like a discontented fairy or like one of those supernatural beings whom it was popularly supposed i was entitled to see and never came back any more no i lay in my basket and my mother lay in her bed but betsey trotwood copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows the tremendous region whence i had so lately travelled and the light upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such travellers and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he without whom i had never been i observe the first objects that assume a distinct presence before me as i look far back into the blank of my infancy are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape and peggotty with no shape at all and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face and cheeks and arms so hard and red that i wondered the birds didn’t peck her in preference to apples i believe i can remember these two at a little distance apart dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor and i going unsteadily from the one to the other i have an impression on my mind which i cannot distinguish from actual remembrance of the touch of peggotty’s forefinger as she used to hold it out to me and of its being roughened by needlework like a pocket nutmeg grater this may be fancy though i think the memory of most of us can go farther back into such times than many of us suppose just as i believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy indeed i think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty than to have acquired it the rather as i generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness and gentleness and capacity of being pleased which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood i might have a misgiving that i am ‘meandering’ in stopping to say this but that it brings me to remark that i build these conclusions in part upon my own experience of myself and if it should appear from anything i may set down in this narrative that i was a child of close observation or that as a man i have a strong memory of my childhood i undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics looking back as i was saying into the blank of my infancy the first objects i can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things are my mother and peggotty what else do i remember let me see there comes out of the cloud our house not new to me but quite familiar in its earliest remembrance on the ground floor is peggotty’s kitchen opening into a back yard with a pigeon house on a pole in the centre without any pigeons in it a great dog kennel in a corner without any dog and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me walking about in a menacing and ferocious manner there is one cock who gets upon a post to crow and seems to take particular notice of me as i look at him through the kitchen window who makes me shiver he is so fierce of the geese outside the side gate who come waddling after me with their long necks stretched out when i go that way i dream at night as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions here is a long passage what an enormous perspective i make of it leading from peggotty’s kitchen to the front door a dark store room opens out of it and that is a place to be run past at night for i don’t know what may be among those tubs and jars and old tea chests when there is nobody in there with a dimly burning light letting a mouldy air come out of the door in which there is the smell of soap pickles pepper candles and coffee all at one whiff then there are the two parlours the parlour in which we sit of an evening my mother and i and peggotty for peggotty is quite our companion when her work is done and we are alone and the best parlour where we sit on a sunday grandly but not so comfortably there is something of a doleful air about that room to me for peggotty has told me i don’t know when but apparently ages ago about my father’s funeral and the company having their black cloaks put on one sunday night my mother reads to peggotty and me in there how lazarus was raised up from the dead and i am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window with the dead all lying in their graves at rest below the solemn moon there is nothing half so green that i know anywhere as the grass of that churchyard nothing half so shady as its trees nothing half so quiet as its tombstones the sheep are feeding there when i kneel up early in the morning in my little bed in a closet within my mother’s room to look out at it and i see the red light shining on the sun dial and think within myself ‘is the sun dial glad i wonder that it can tell the time again ’ here is our pew in the church what a high backed pew with a window near it out of which our house can be seen and is seen many times during the morning’s service by peggotty who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it’s not being robbed or is not in flames but though peggotty’s eye wanders she is much offended if mine does and frowns to me as i stand upon the seat that i am to look at the clergyman but i can’t always look at him i know him without that white thing on and i am afraid of his wondering why i stare so and perhaps stopping the service to inquire and what am i to do it’s a dreadful thing to gape but i must do something i look at my mother but she pretends not to see me i look at a boy in the aisle and he makes faces at me i look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch and there i see a stray sheep i don’t mean a sinner but mutton half making up his mind to come into the church i feel that if i looked at him any longer i might be tempted to say something out loud and what would become of me then i look up at the monumental tablets on the wall and try to think of mr bodgers late of this parish and what the feelings of mrs bodgers must have been when affliction sore long time mr bodgers bore and physicians were in vain i wonder whether they called in mr chillip and he was in vain and if so how he likes to be reminded of it once a week i look from mr chillip in his sunday neckcloth to the pulpit and think what a good place it would be to play in and what a castle it would make with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head in time my eyes gradually shut up and from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat i hear nothing until i fall off the seat with a crash and am taken out more dead than alive by peggotty and now i see the outside of our house with the latticed bedroom windows standing open to let in the sweet smelling air and the ragged old rooks’ nests still dangling in the elm trees at the bottom of the front garden now i am in the garden at the back beyond the yard where the empty pigeon house and dog kennel are a very preserve of butterflies as i remember it with a high fence and a gate and padlock where the fruit clusters on the trees riper and richer than fruit has ever been since in any other garden and where my mother gathers some in a basket while i stand by bolting furtive gooseberries and trying to look unmoved a great wind rises and the summer is gone in a moment we are playing in the winter twilight dancing about the parlour when my mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbow chair i watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers and straitening her waist and nobody knows better than i do that she likes to look so well and is proud of being so pretty that is among my very earliest impressions that and a sense that we were both a little afraid of peggotty and submitted ourselves in most things to her direction were among the first opinions if they may be so called that i ever derived from what i saw peggotty and i were sitting one night by the parlour fire alone i had been reading to peggotty about crocodiles i must have read very perspicuously or the poor soul must have been deeply interested for i remember she had a cloudy impression after i had done that they were a sort of vegetable i was tired of reading and dead sleepy but having leave as a high treat to sit up until my mother came home from spending the evening at a neighbour’s i would rather have died upon my post of course than have gone to bed i had reached that stage of sleepiness when peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large i propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers and looked perseveringly at her as she sat at work at the little bit of wax candle she kept for her thread how old it looked being so wrinkled in all directions at the little house with a thatched roof where the yard measure lived at her work box with a sliding lid with a view of st paul’s cathedral with a pink dome painted on the top at the brass thimble on her finger at herself whom i thought lovely i felt so sleepy that i knew if i lost sight of anything for a moment i was gone ‘peggotty ’ says i suddenly ‘were you ever married ’ ‘lord master davy ’ replied peggotty ‘what’s put marriage in your head ’ she answered with such a start that it quite awoke me and then she stopped in her work and looked at me with her needle drawn out to its thread’s length ‘but were you ever married peggotty ’ says i ‘you are a very handsome woman an’t you ’ i thought her in a different style from my mother certainly but of another school of beauty i considered her a perfect example there was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour on which my mother had painted a nosegay the ground work of that stool and peggotty’s complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing the stool was smooth and peggotty was rough but that made no difference ‘me handsome davy ’ said peggotty ‘lawk no my dear but what put marriage in your head ’ ‘i don’t know you mustn’t marry more than one person at a time may you peggotty ’ ‘certainly not ’ says peggotty with the promptest decision ‘but if you marry a person and the person dies why then you may marry another person mayn’t you peggotty ’ ‘you may ’ says peggotty ‘if you choose my dear that’s a matter of opinion ’ ‘but what is your opinion peggotty ’ said i i asked her and looked curiously at her because she looked so curiously at me ‘my opinion is ’ said peggotty taking her eyes from me after a little indecision and going on with her work ‘that i never was married myself master davy and that i don’t expect to be that’s all i know about the subject ’ ‘you an’t cross i suppose peggotty are you ’ said i after sitting quiet for a minute i really thought she was she had been so short with me but i was quite mistaken for she laid aside her work which was a stocking of her own and opening her arms wide took my curly head within them and gave it a good squeeze i know it was a good squeeze because being very plump whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed some of the buttons on the back of her gown flew off and i recollect two bursting to the opposite side of the parlour while she was hugging me ‘now let me hear some more about the crorkindills ’ said peggotty who was not quite right in the name yet ‘for i an’t heard half enough ’ i couldn’t quite understand why peggotty looked so queer or why she was so ready to go back to the crocodiles however we returned to those monsters with fresh wakefulness on my part and we left their eggs in the sand for the sun to hatch and we ran away from them and baffled them by constantly turning which they were unable to do quickly on account of their unwieldy make and we went into the water after them as natives and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats and in short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet i did at least but i had my doubts of peggotty who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into various parts of her face and arms all the time we had exhausted the crocodiles and begun with the alligators when the garden bell rang we went out to the door and there was my mother looking unusually pretty i thought and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers who had walked home with us from church last sunday as my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and kiss me the gentleman said i was a more highly privileged little fellow than a monarch or something like that for my later understanding comes i am sensible to my aid here ‘what does that mean ’ i asked him over her shoulder he patted me on the head but somehow i didn’t like him or his deep voice and i was jealous that his hand should touch my mother’s in touching me which it did i put it away as well as i could ‘oh davy ’ remonstrated my mother ‘dear boy ’ said the gentleman ‘i cannot wonder at his devotion ’ i never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother’s face before she gently chid me for being rude and keeping me close to her shawl turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her home she put out her hand to him as she spoke and as he met it with his own she glanced i thought at me ‘let us say “good night” my fine boy ’ said the gentleman when he had bent his head i saw him over my mother’s little glove ‘good night ’ said i ‘come let us be the best friends in the world ’ said the gentleman laughing ‘shake hands ’ my right hand was in my mother’s left so i gave him the other ‘why that’s the wrong hand davy ’ laughed the gentleman my mother drew my right hand forward but i was resolved for my former reason not to give it him and i did not i gave him the other and he shook it heartily and said i was a brave fellow and went away at this minute i see him turn round in the garden and give us a last look with his ill omened black eyes before the door was shut peggotty who had not said a word or moved a finger secured the fastenings instantly and we all went into the parlour my mother contrary to her usual habit instead of coming to the elbow chair by the fire remained at the other end of the room and sat singing to herself ‘hope you have had a pleasant evening ma’am ’ said peggotty standing as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room with a candlestick in her hand ‘much obliged to you peggotty ’ returned my mother in a cheerful voice ‘i have had a very pleasant evening ’ ‘a stranger or so makes an agreeable change ’ suggested peggotty ‘a very agreeable change indeed ’ returned my mother peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room and my mother resuming her singing i fell asleep though i was not so sound asleep but that i could hear voices without hearing what they said when i half awoke from this uncomfortable doze i found peggotty and my mother both in tears and both talking ‘not such a one as this mr copperfield wouldn’t have liked ’ said peggotty ‘that i say and that i swear ’ ‘good heavens ’ cried my mother ‘you’ll drive me mad was ever any poor girl so ill used by her servants as i am why do i do myself the injustice of calling myself a girl have i never been married peggotty ’ ‘god knows you have ma’am ’ returned peggotty ‘then how can you dare ’ said my mother ‘you know i don’t mean how can you dare peggotty but how can you have the heart to make me so uncomfortable and say such bitter things to me when you are well aware that i haven’t out of this place a single friend to turn to ’ ‘the more’s the reason ’ returned peggotty ‘for saying that it won’t do no that it won’t do no no price could make it do no ’ i thought peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away she was so emphatic with it ‘how can you be so aggravating ’ said my mother shedding more tears than before ‘as to talk in such an unjust manner how can you go on as if it was all settled and arranged peggotty when i tell you over and over again you cruel thing that beyond the commonest civilities nothing has passed you talk of admiration what am i to do if people are so silly as to indulge the sentiment is it my fault what am i to do i ask you would you wish me to shave my head and black my face or disfigure myself with a burn or a scald or something of that sort i dare say you would peggotty i dare say you’d quite enjoy it ’ peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart i thought ‘and my dear boy ’ cried my mother coming to the elbow chair in which i was and caressing me ‘my own little davy is it to be hinted to me that i am wanting in affection for my precious treasure the dearest little fellow that ever was ’ ‘nobody never went and hinted no such a thing ’ said peggotty ‘you did peggotty ’ returned my mother ‘you know you did what else was it possible to infer from what you said you unkind creature when you know as well as i do that on his account only last quarter i wouldn’t buy myself a new parasol though that old green one is frayed the whole way up and the fringe is perfectly mangy you know it is peggotty you can’t deny it ’ then turning affectionately to me with her cheek against mine ‘am i a naughty mama to you davy am i a nasty cruel selfish bad mama say i am my child say “yes” dear boy and peggotty will love you and peggotty’s love is a great deal better than mine davy i don’t love you at all do i ’ at this we all fell a crying together i think i was the loudest of the party but i am sure we were all sincere about it i was quite heart broken myself and am afraid that in the first transports of wounded tenderness i called peggotty a ‘beast’ that honest creature was in deep affliction i remember and must have become quite buttonless on the occasion for a little volley of those explosives went off when after having made it up with my mother she kneeled down by the elbow chair and made it up with me we went to bed greatly dejected my sobs kept waking me for a long time and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed i found my mother sitting on the coverlet and leaning over me i fell asleep in her arms after that and slept soundly whether it was the following sunday when i saw the gentleman again or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared i cannot recall i don’t profess to be clear about dates but there he was in church and he walked home with us afterwards he came in too to look at a famous geranium we had in the parlour window it did not appear to me that he took much notice of it but before he went he asked my mother to give him a bit of the blossom she begged him to choose it for himself but he refused to do that i could not understand why so she plucked it for him and gave it into his hand he said he would never never part with it any more and i thought he must be quite a fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two peggotty began to be less with us of an evening than she had always been my mother deferred to her very much more than usual it occurred to me and we were all three excellent friends still we were different from what we used to be and were not so comfortable among ourselves sometimes i fancied that peggotty perhaps objected to my mother’s wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers or to her going so often to visit at that neighbour’s but i couldn’t to my satisfaction make out how it was gradually i became used to seeing the gentleman with the black whiskers i liked him no better than at first and had the same uneasy jealousy of him but if i had any reason for it beyond a child’s instinctive dislike and a general idea that peggotty and i could make much of my mother without any help it certainly was not the reason that i might have found if i had been older no such thing came into my mind or near it i could observe in little pieces as it were but as to making a net of a number of these pieces and catching anybody in it that was as yet beyond me one autumn morning i was with my mother in the front garden when mr murdstone i knew him by that name now came by on horseback he reined up his horse to salute my mother and said he was going to lowestoft to see some friends who were there with a yacht and merrily proposed to take me on the saddle before him if i would like the ride the air was so clear and pleasant and the horse seemed to like the idea of the ride so much himself as he stood snorting and pawing at the garden gate that i had a great desire to go so i was sent upstairs to peggotty to be made spruce and in the meantime mr murdstone dismounted and with his horse’s bridle drawn over his arm walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence while my mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company i recollect peggotty and i peeping out at them from my little window i recollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between them as they strolled along and how from being in a perfectly angelic temper peggotty turned cross in a moment and brushed my hair the wrong way excessively hard mr murdstone and i were soon off and trotting along on the green turf by the side of the road he held me quite easily with one arm and i don’t think i was restless usually but i could not make up my mind to sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes and looking up in his face he had that kind of shallow black eye i want a better word to express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into which when it is abstracted seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured for a moment at a time by a cast several times when i glanced at him i observed that appearance with a sort of awe and wondered what he was thinking about so closely his hair and whiskers were blacker and thicker looked at so near than even i had given them credit for being a squareness about the lower part of his face and the dotted indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day reminded me of the wax work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half a year before this his regular eyebrows and the rich white and black and brown of his complexion confound his complexion and his memory made me think him in spite of my misgivings a very handsome man i have no doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too we went to an hotel by the sea where two gentlemen were smoking cigars in a room by themselves each of them was lying on at least four chairs and had a large rough jacket on in a corner was a heap of coats and boat cloaks and a flag all bundled up together they both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner when we came in and said ‘halloa murdstone we thought you were dead ’ ‘not yet ’ said mr murdstone ‘and who’s this shaver ’ said one of the gentlemen taking hold of me ‘that’s davy ’ returned mr murdstone ‘davy who ’ said the gentleman ‘jones ’ ‘copperfield ’ said mr murdstone ‘what bewitching mrs copperfield’s encumbrance ’ cried the gentleman ‘the pretty little widow ’ ‘quinion ’ said mr murdstone ‘take care if you please somebody’s sharp ’ ‘who is ’ asked the gentleman laughing i looked up quickly being curious to know ‘only brooks of sheffield ’ said mr murdstone i was quite relieved to find that it was only brooks of sheffield for at first i really thought it was i there seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of mr brooks of sheffield for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned and mr murdstone was a good deal amused also after some laughing the gentleman whom he had called quinion said ‘and what is the opinion of brooks of sheffield in reference to the projected business ’ ‘why i don’t know that brooks understands much about it at present ’ replied mr murdstone ‘but he is not generally favourable i believe ’ there was more laughter at this and mr quinion said he would ring the bell for some sherry in which to drink to brooks this he did and when the wine came he made me have a little with a biscuit and before i drank it stand up and say ‘confusion to brooks of sheffield ’ the toast was received with great applause and such hearty laughter that it made me laugh too at which they laughed the more in short we quite enjoyed ourselves we walked about on the cliff after that and sat on the grass and looked at things through a telescope i could make out nothing myself when it was put to my eye but i pretended i could and then we came back to the hotel to an early dinner all the time we were out the two gentlemen smoked incessantly which i thought if i might judge from the smell of their rough coats they must have been doing ever since the coats had first come home from the tailor’s i must not forget that we went on board the yacht where they all three descended into the cabin and were busy with some papers i saw them quite hard at work when i looked down through the open skylight they left me during this time with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it who had got a cross barred shirt or waistcoat on with ‘skylark’ in capital letters across the chest i thought it was his name and that as he lived on board ship and hadn’t a street door to put his name on he put it there instead but when i called him mr skylark he said it meant the vessel i observed all day that mr murdstone was graver and steadier than the two gentlemen they were very gay and careless they joked freely with one another but seldom with him it appeared to me that he was more clever and cold than they were and that they regarded him with something of my own feeling i remarked that once or twice when mr quinion was talking he looked at mr murdstone sideways as if to make sure of his not being displeased and that once when mr passnidge the other gentleman was in high spirits he trod upon his foot and gave him a secret caution with his eyes to observe mr murdstone who was sitting stern and silent nor do i recollect that mr murdstone laughed at all that day except at the sheffield joke and that by the by was his own we went home early in the evening it was a very fine evening and my mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar while i was sent in to get my tea when he was gone my mother asked me all about the day i had had and what they had said and done i mentioned what they had said about her and she laughed and told me they were impudent fellows who talked nonsense but i knew it pleased her i knew it quite as well as i know it now i took the opportunity of asking if she was at all acquainted with mr brooks of sheffield but she answered no only she supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way can i say of her face altered as i have reason to remember it perished as i know it is that it is gone when here it comes before me at this instant as distinct as any face that i may choose to look on in a crowded street can i say of her innocent and girlish beauty that it faded and was no more when its breath falls on my cheek now as it fell that night can i say she ever changed when my remembrance brings her back to life thus only and truer to its loving youth than i have been or man ever is still holds fast what it cherished then i write of her just as she was when i had gone to bed after this talk and she came to bid me good night she kneeled down playfully by the side of the bed and laying her chin upon her hands and laughing said ‘what was it they said davy tell me again i can’t believe it ’ ‘“bewitching “’ i began my mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me ‘it was never bewitching ’ she said laughing ‘it never could have been bewitching davy now i know it wasn’t ’ ‘yes it was “bewitching mrs copperfield” ’ i repeated stoutly ‘and “pretty ”’ ‘no no it was never pretty not pretty ’ interposed my mother laying her fingers on my lips again ‘yes it was “pretty little widow ”’ ‘what foolish impudent creatures ’ cried my mother laughing and covering her face ‘what ridiculous men an’t they davy dear ’ ‘well ma ’ ‘don’t tell peggotty she might be angry with them i am dreadfully angry with them myself but i would rather peggotty didn’t know ’ i promised of course and we kissed one another over and over again and i soon fell fast asleep it seems to me at this distance of time as if it were the next day when peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition i am about to mention but it was probably about two months afterwards we were sitting as before one evening when my mother was out as before in company with the stocking and the yard measure and the bit of wax and the box with st paul’s on the lid and the crocodile book when peggotty after looking at me several times and opening her mouth as if she were going to speak without doing it which i thought was merely gaping or i should have been rather alarmed said coaxingly ‘master davy how should you like to go along with me and spend a fortnight at my brother’s at yarmouth wouldn’t that be a treat ’ ‘is your brother an agreeable man peggotty ’ i inquired provisionally ‘oh what an agreeable man he is ’ cried peggotty holding up her hands ‘then there’s the sea and the boats and ships and the fishermen and the beach and am to play with ’ peggotty meant her nephew ham mentioned in my first but she spoke of him as a morsel of english grammar i was flushed by her summary of delights and replied that it would indeed be a treat but what would my mother say ‘why then i’ll as good as bet a guinea ’ said peggotty intent upon my face ‘that she’ll let us go i’ll ask her if you like as soon as ever she comes home there now ’ ‘but what’s she to do while we’re away ’ said i putting my small elbows on the table to argue the point ‘she can’t live by herself ’ if peggotty were looking for a hole all of a sudden in the heel of that stocking it must have been a very little one indeed and not worth darning ‘i say peggotty she can’t live by herself you know ’ ‘oh bless you ’ said peggotty looking at me again at last ‘don’t you know she’s going to stay for a fortnight with mrs grayper mrs grayper’s going to have a lot of company ’ oh if that was it i was quite ready to go i waited in the utmost impatience until my mother came home from mrs grayper’s for it was that identical neighbour to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out this great idea without being nearly so much surprised as i had expected my mother entered into it readily and it was all arranged that night and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for the day soon came for our going it was such an early day that it came soon even to me who was in a fever of expectation and half afraid that an earthquake or a fiery mountain or some other great convulsion of nature might interpose to stop the expedition we were to go in a carrier’s cart which departed in the morning after breakfast i would have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over night and sleep in my hat and boots it touches me nearly now although i tell it lightly to recollect how eager i was to leave my happy home to think how little i suspected what i did leave for ever i am glad to recollect that when the carrier’s cart was at the gate and my mother stood there kissing me a grateful fondness for her and for the old place i had never turned my back upon before made me cry i am glad to know that my mother cried too and that i felt her heart beat against mine i am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move my mother ran out at the gate and called to him to stop that she might kiss me once more i am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted up her face to mine and did so as we left her standing in the road mr murdstone came up to where she was and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved i was looking back round the awning of the cart and wondered what business it was of his peggotty who was also looking back on the other side seemed anything but satisfied as the face she brought back in the cart denoted i sat looking at peggotty for some time in a reverie on this supposititious case whether if she were employed to lose me like the boy in the fairy tale i should be able to track my way home again by the buttons she would shed'),\n",

bring up these children stick to facts sir ’ the scene was a plain bare monotonous vault of a school room and the speaker’s square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring every sentence with a line on the schoolmaster’s sleeve the emphasis was helped by the speaker’s square wall of a forehead which had his eyebrows for its base while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves overshadowed by the wall the emphasis was helped by the speaker’s mouth which was wide thin and hard set the emphasis was helped by the speaker’s voice which was inflexible dry and dictatorial the emphasis was helped by the speaker’s hair which bristled on the skirts of his bald head a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface all covered with knobs like the crust of a plum pie as if the head had scarcely warehouse room for the hard facts stored inside the speaker’s obstinate carriage square coat square legs square shoulders —nay his very neckcloth trained to take him by the throat with an unaccommodating grasp like a stubborn fact as it was —all helped the emphasis ‘in this life we want nothing but facts sir nothing but facts ’ the speaker and the schoolmaster

into them until they were full to the brim ii murdering the innocents thomas gradgrind sir a man of realities a man of facts and calculations a man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are

to get some other nonsensical belief into the head of george gradgrind or augustus gradgrind or john gradgrind or joseph gradgrind all supposititious non existent persons but into the head of thomas gradgrind—no sir in such terms mr gradgrind always mentally introduced himself whether to his private circle of acquaintance or to the public in general in such terms no doubt substituting the words ‘boys and girls ’ for ‘sir ’ thomas gradgrind now presented thomas gradgrind to the little pitchers before him who were to be filled so full of facts indeed as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before mentioned he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one discharge he seemed a galvanizing apparatus too charged with a grim mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be stormed away ‘girl number twenty ’ said mr gradgrind squarely pointing with his square forefinger ‘i don’t know that girl who is that girl ’ ‘sissy jupe sir ’ explained number twenty blushing standing up and curtseying ‘sissy is not a name ’ said mr gradgrind ‘don’t call yourself sissy call yourself cecilia ’ ‘it’s father as calls me sissy sir ’ returned the young girl in a trembling voice and with another curtsey ‘then he has no business to do it ’ said mr gradgrind ‘tell him he mustn’t cecilia jupe let me see what is your father ’ ‘he belongs to the horse riding if you please sir ’ mr gradgrind frowned and waved off the objectionable calling with his hand ‘we don’t want to know anything about that here you mustn’t tell us about that here your father breaks horses don’t he ’ ‘if you please sir when they can get any to break they do break horses in the ring sir ’ ‘you mustn’t tell us about the ring here very well then describe your father as a horsebreaker he doctors sick horses i dare say ’ ‘oh yes sir ’ ‘very well then he is a veterinary surgeon a farrier and horsebreaker give me your definition of a horse ’ sissy jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand ‘girl number twenty unable to define a horse ’ said mr gradgrind for the general behoof of all the little pitchers ‘girl number twenty possessed of no facts in reference to one of the commonest of animals some boy’s definition of a horse bitzer yours ’ the square finger moving here and there lighted suddenly on bitzer perhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which darting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white washed room irradiated sissy for the boys and girls sat on the face of the inclined plane in two compact bodies divided up the centre by a narrow interval and sissy being at the corner of a row on the sunny side came in for the beginning of a sunbeam of which bitzer being at the corner of a row on the other side a few rows in advance caught the end but whereas the girl was so dark eyed and dark haired that she seemed to receive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun when it shone upon her the boy was so light eyed and light haired that the self same rays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he ever possessed his cold eyes would hardly have been eyes but for the short ends of lashes which by bringing them into immediate contrast with something paler than themselves expressed their form his short cropped hair might have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead and face his skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge that he looked as though if he were cut he would bleed white ‘bitzer ’ said thomas gradgrind ‘your definition of a horse ’ ‘quadruped graminivorous forty teeth namely twenty four grinders four eye teeth and twelve incisive sheds coat in the spring in marshy countries sheds hoofs too hoofs hard but requiring to be shod with iron age known by marks in mouth ’ thus and much more bitzer ‘now girl number twenty ’ said mr gradgrind ‘you know what a horse is ’ she curtseyed again and would have blushed deeper if she could have blushed deeper than she had blushed all this time bitzer after rapidly blinking at thomas gradgrind with both eyes at once and so catching the light upon his quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antennæ of busy insects put his knuckles to his freckled forehead and sat down again the third gentleman now stepped forth a mighty man at cutting and drying he was a government officer in his way and in most other people’s too a professed pugilist always in training always with a system to force down the general throat like a bolus always to be heard of at the bar of his little public office ready to fight all england to continue in fistic phraseology he had a genius for coming up to the scratch wherever and whatever it was and proving himself an ugly customer he would go in and damage any subject whatever with his right follow up with his left stop exchange counter bore his opponent he always fought all england to the ropes and fall upon him neatly he was certain to knock the wind out of common sense and render that unlucky adversary deaf to the call of time and he had it in charge from high authority to bring about the great public office millennium when commissioners should reign upon earth ‘very well ’ said this gentleman briskly smiling and folding his arms ‘that’s a horse now let me ask you girls and boys would you paper a room with representations of horses ’ after a pause one half of the children cried in chorus ‘yes sir ’ upon which the other half seeing in the gentleman’s face that yes was wrong cried out in chorus ‘no sir ’—as the custom is in these examinations ‘of course no why wouldn’t you ’ a pause one corpulent slow boy with a wheezy manner of breathing ventured the answer because he wouldn’t paper a room at all but would paint it ‘you _must_ paper it ’ said the gentleman rather warmly ‘you must paper it ’ said thomas gradgrind ‘whether you like it or not don’t tell _us_ you wouldn’t paper it what do you mean boy ’ ‘i’ll explain to you then ’ said the gentleman after another and a dismal pause ‘why you wouldn’t paper a room with representations of horses do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality—in fact do you ’ ‘yes sir ’ from one half ‘no sir ’ from the other ‘of course no ’ said the gentleman with an indignant look at the wrong half ‘why then you are not to see anywhere what you don’t see in fact you are not to have anywhere what you don’t have in fact what is called taste is only another name for fact ’ thomas gradgrind nodded his approbation ‘this is a new principle a discovery a great discovery ’ said the gentleman ‘now i’ll try you again suppose you were going to carpet a room would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it ’ there being a general conviction by this time that ‘no sir ’ was always the right answer to this gentleman the chorus of no was very strong only a few feeble stragglers said yes among them sissy jupe ‘girl number twenty ’ said the gentleman smiling in the calm strength of knowledge sissy blushed and stood up ‘so you would carpet your room—or your husband’s room if you were a grown woman and had a husband—with representations of flowers would you ’ said the gentleman ‘why would you ’ ‘if you please sir i am very fond of flowers ’ returned the girl ‘and is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them and have people walking over them with heavy boots ’ ‘it wouldn’t hurt them sir they wouldn’t crush and wither if you please sir they would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant and i would fancy—’ ‘ay ay ay but you mustn’t fancy ’ cried the gentleman quite elated by coming so happily to his point ‘that’s it you are never to fancy ’ ‘you are not cecilia jupe ’ thomas gradgrind solemnly repeated ‘to do anything of that kind ’ ‘fact fact fact ’ said the gentleman and ‘fact fact fact ’ repeated thomas gradgrind ‘you are to be in all things regulated and governed ’ said the gentleman ‘by fact we hope to have before long a board of fact composed of commissioners of fact who will force the people to be a people of fact and of nothing but fact you must discard the word fancy altogether you have nothing to do with it you are not to have in any object of use or ornament what would be a contradiction in fact you don’t walk upon flowers in fact you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets you don’t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery you never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls you must use ’ said the gentleman ‘for all these purposes combinations and modifications in primary colours of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration this is the new discovery this is fact this is taste ’ the girl curtseyed and sat down she was very young and she looked as if she were frightened by the matter of fact prospect the world afforded ‘now if mr m’choakumchild ’ said the gentleman ‘will proceed to give his first lesson here mr gradgrind i shall be happy at your request to observe his mode of procedure ’ mr gradgrind was much obliged ‘mr m’choakumchild we only wait for you ’ so mr m’choakumchild began in his best manner he and some one hundred and forty other schoolmasters had been lately turned at the same time in the same factory on the same principles like so many pianoforte legs he had been put through an immense variety of paces and had answered volumes of head breaking questions orthography etymology syntax and prosody biography astronomy geography and general cosmography the sciences of compound proportion algebra land surveying and levelling vocal music and drawing from models were all at the ends of his ten chilled fingers he had worked his stony way into her majesty’s most honourable privy council’s schedule b and had taken the bloom off the higher branches of mathematics and physical science french german latin and greek he knew all about all the water sheds of all the world whatever they are and all the histories of all the peoples and all the names of all the rivers and mountains and all the productions manners and customs of all the countries and all their boundaries and bearings on the two and thirty points of the compass ah rather overdone m’choakumchild if he had only learnt a little less how infinitely better he might have taught much more he went to work in this preparatory lesson not unlike morgiana in the forty thieves looking into all the vessels ranged before him one after another to see what they contained say

with the view just mentioned this association has taken into its serious consideration a proposal emanating from the aforesaid samuel pickwick esq g c m p c and three other pickwickians hereinafter named for forming a new branch of united pickwickians under the title of the corresponding society of the pickwick club ‘that the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this association ‘that the corresponding society of the pickwick club is therefore hereby constituted and that samuel pickwick esq g c m p c tracy tupman esq m p c augustus snodgrass esq m p c and nathaniel winkle esq m p c are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same and that they be requested to forward from time to time authenticated accounts of their journeys and investigations of their observations of character and manners and of the whole of their adventures together with all tales and papers to which local scenery or associations may give rise to the pickwick club stationed in london ‘that this association cordially recognises the principle of every member of the corresponding society defraying his own travelling expenses and that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the said society pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they please upon the same terms ‘that the members of the aforesaid corresponding society be and are hereby informed that their proposal to pay the postage of their letters and the carriage of their parcels has been deliberated upon by this association that this association considers such proposal worthy of the great minds from which it emanated and that it hereby signifies its perfect acquiescence therein ’ a casual observer adds the secretary to whose notes we are indebted for the following account a casual observer might possibly have remarked nothing extraordinary in the bald head and circular spectacles which were intently turned towards his the secretary’s face during the reading of the above resolutions to those who knew that the gigantic brain of pickwick was working beneath that forehead and that the beaming eyes of pickwick were twinkling behind those glasses the sight was indeed an interesting one there sat the man who had traced to their source the mighty ponds of hampstead and agitated the scientific world with his theory of tittlebats as calm and unmoved as the deep waters of the one on a frosty day or as a solitary specimen of the other in the inmost recesses of an earthen jar and how much more interesting did the spectacle become when starting into full life and animation as a simultaneous call for ‘pickwick’ burst from his followers that illustrious man slowly mounted into the windsor chair on which he had been previously seated and addressed the club himself had founded what a study for an artist did that exciting scene present the eloquent pickwick with one hand gracefully concealed behind his coat tails and the other waving in air to assist his glowing declamation his elevated position revealing those tights and gaiters which had they clothed an ordinary man might have passed without observation but which when pickwick clothed them if we may use the expression inspired involuntary awe and respect surrounded by the men who had volunteered to share the perils of his travels and who were destined to participate in the glories of his discoveries on his right sat mr tracy tupman the too susceptible tupman who to the wisdom and experience of maturer years superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a boy in the most interesting and pardonable of human weaknesses love time and feeding had expanded that once romantic form the black silk waistcoat had become more and more developed inch by inch had the gold watch chain beneath it disappeared from within the range of tupman’s vision and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders of the white cravat but the soul of tupman had known no change admiration of the fair sex was still its ruling passion on the left of his great leader sat the poetic snodgrass and near him again the sporting winkle the former poetically enveloped in a mysterious blue cloak with a canine skin collar and the latter communicating additional lustre to a new green shooting coat plaid neckerchief and closely fitted drabs mr pickwick’s oration upon this occasion together with the debate thereon is entered on the transactions of the club both bear a strong affinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies and as it is always interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of great men we transfer the entry to these pages ‘mr pickwick observed says the secretary that fame was dear to the heart of every man poetic fame was dear to the heart of his friend snodgrass the fame of conquest was equally dear to his friend tupman and the desire of earning fame in the sports of the field the air and the water was uppermost in the breast of his friend winkle he mr pickwick would not deny that he was influenced by human passions and human feelings cheers possibly by human weaknesses loud cries of “no” but this he would say that if ever the fire of self importance broke out in his bosom the desire to benefit the human race in preference effectually quenched it the praise of mankind was his swing philanthropy was his insurance office vehement cheering he had felt some pride he acknowledged it freely and let his enemies make the most of it he had felt some pride when he presented his tittlebatian theory to the world it might be celebrated or it might not a cry of “it is ” and great cheering he would take the assertion of that honourable pickwickian whose voice he had just heard it was celebrated but if the fame of that treatise were to extend to the farthest confines of the known world the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of that production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which he looked around him on this the proudest moment of his existence cheers he was a humble individual “no no ” still he could not but feel that they had selected him for a service of great honour and of some danger travelling was in a troubled state and the minds of coachmen were unsettled let them look abroad and contemplate the scenes which were enacting around them stage coaches were upsetting in all directions horses were bolting boats were overturning and boilers were bursting cheers a voice “no ” no cheers let that honourable pickwickian who cried “no” so loudly come forward and deny it if he could cheers who was it that cried “no” enthusiastic cheering was it some vain and disappointed man he would not say haberdasher loud cheers who jealous of the praise which had been perhaps undeservedly bestowed on his mr pickwick’s researches and smarting under the censure which had been heaped upon his own feeble attempts at rivalry now took this vile and calumnious mode of ‘mr blotton of aldgate rose to order did the honourable pickwickian allude to him cries of “order ” “chair ” “yes ” “no ” “go on ” “leave off ” etc ‘mr pickwick would not put up to be put down by clamour he had alluded to the honourable gentleman great excitement ‘mr blotton would only say then that he repelled the hon gent ’s false and scurrilous accusation with profound contempt great cheering the hon gent was a humbug immense confusion and loud cries of “chair ” and “order ” ‘mr a snodgrass rose to order he threw himself upon the chair hear he wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two members of that club should be allowed to continue hear hear ‘the chairman was quite sure the hon pickwickian would withdraw the expression he had just made use of ‘mr blotton with all possible respect for the chair was quite sure he would not ‘the chairman felt it his imperative duty to demand of the honourable gentleman whether he had used the expression which had just escaped him in a common sense ‘mr blotton had no hesitation in saying that he had not he had used the word in its pickwickian sense hear hear he was bound to acknowledge that personally he entertained the highest regard and esteem for the honourable gentleman he had merely considered him a humbug in a pickwickian point of view hear hear ‘mr pickwick felt much gratified by the fair candid and full explanation of his honourable friend he begged it to be at once understood that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a pickwickian construction cheers ’ here the entry terminates as we have no doubt the debate did also after arriving at such a highly satisfactory and intelligible point we have no official statement of the facts which the reader will find recorded in the next but they have been carefully collated from letters and other ms authorities so unquestionably genuine as to justify their narration in a connected form ii the first day’s journey and the first evening’s adventures with their consequences that punctual servant of all work the sun had just risen and begun to strike a light on the morning of the thirteenth of may one thousand eight hundred and twenty seven when mr samuel pickwick burst like another sun from his slumbers threw open his chamber window and looked out upon the world beneath goswell street was at his feet goswell street was on his right hand as far as the eye could reach goswell street extended on his left and the opposite side of goswell street was over the way ‘such ’ thought mr pickwick ‘are the narrow views of those philosophers who content with examining the things that lie before them look not to the truths which are hidden beyond as well might i be content to gaze on goswell street for ever without one effort to penetrate to the hidden countries which on every side surround it ’ and having given vent to this beautiful reflection mr pickwick proceeded to put himself into his clothes and his clothes into his portmanteau great men are seldom over scrupulous in the arrangement of their attire the operation of shaving dressing and coffee imbibing was soon performed and in another hour mr pickwick with his portmanteau in his hand his telescope in his greatcoat pocket and his note book in his waistcoat ready for the reception of any discoveries worthy of being noted down had arrived at the coach stand in st martin’s le grand ‘cab ’ said mr pickwick ‘here you are sir ’ shouted a strange specimen of the human race in a sackcloth coat and apron of the same who with a brass label and number round his neck looked as if he were catalogued in some collection of rarities this was the waterman ‘here you are sir now then fust cab ’ and the first cab having been fetched from the public house where he had been smoking his first pipe mr pickwick and his portmanteau were thrown into the vehicle ‘golden cross ’ said mr pickwick ‘only a bob’s vorth tommy ’ cried the driver sulkily for the information of his friend the waterman as the cab drove off ‘how old is that horse my friend ’ inquired mr pickwick rubbing his nose with the shilling he had reserved for the fare ‘forty two ’ replied the driver eyeing him askant ‘what ’ ejaculated mr pickwick laying his hand upon his note book the driver reiterated his former statement mr pickwick looked very hard at the man’s face but his features were immovable so he noted down the fact forthwith ‘and how long do you keep him out at a time ’ inquired mr pickwick searching for further information ‘two or three veeks ’ replied the man ‘weeks ’ said mr pickwick in astonishment and out came the note book again ‘he lives at pentonwil when he’s at home ’ observed the driver coolly ‘but we seldom takes him home on account of his weakness ’ ‘on account of his weakness ’ reiterated the perplexed mr pickwick ‘he always falls down when he’s took out o’ the cab ’ continued the driver ‘but when he’s in it we bears him up werry tight and takes him in werry short so as he can’t werry well fall down and we’ve got a pair o’ precious large wheels on so ven he does move they run after him and he must go on he can’t help it ’ mr pickwick entered every word of this statement in his note book with the view of communicating it to the club as a singular instance of the tenacity of life in horses under trying circumstances the entry was scarcely completed when they reached the golden cross down jumped the driver and out got mr pickwick mr tupman mr snodgrass and mr winkle who had been anxiously waiting the arrival of their illustrious leader crowded to welcome him ‘here’s your fare ’ said mr pickwick holding out the shilling to the driver what was the learned man’s astonishment when that unaccountable person flung the money on the pavement and requested in figurative terms to be allowed the pleasure of fighting him mr pickwick for the amount ‘you are mad ’ said mr snodgrass ‘or drunk ’ said mr winkle ‘or both ’ said mr tupman ‘come on ’ said the cab driver sparring away like clockwork ‘come on all four on you ’ ‘here’s a lark ’ shouted half a dozen hackney coachmen ‘go to vork sam and they crowded with great glee round the party ‘what’s the row sam ’ inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves ‘row ’ replied the cabman ‘what did he want my number for ’ ‘i didn’t want your number ’ said the astonished mr pickwick ‘what did you take it for then ’ inquired the cabman ‘i didn’t take it ’ said mr pickwick indignantly ‘would anybody believe ’ continued the cab driver appealing to the crowd ‘would anybody believe as an informer’ud go about in a man’s cab not only takin’ down his number but ev’ry word he says into the bargain’ a light flashed upon mr pickwick it was the note book ‘did he though ’ inquired another cabman ‘yes did he ’ replied the first ‘and then arter aggerawatin’ me to assault him gets three witnesses here to prove it but i’ll give it him if i’ve six months for it come on ’ and the cabman dashed his hat upon the ground with a reckless disregard of his own private property and knocked mr pickwick’s spectacles off and followed up the attack with a blow on mr pickwick’s nose and another on mr pickwick’s chest and a third in mr snodgrass’s eye and a fourth by way of variety in mr tupman’s waistcoat and then danced into the road and then back again to the pavement and finally dashed the whole temporary supply of breath out of mr winkle’s body and all in half a dozen seconds ‘where’s an officer ’ said mr snodgrass ‘put ‘em under the pump ’ suggested a hot pieman ‘you shall smart for this ’ gasped mr pickwick ‘informers ’ shouted the crowd ‘come on ’ cried the cabman who had been sparring without cessation the whole time the mob hitherto had been passive spectators of the scene but as the intelligence of the pickwickians being informers was spread among them they began to canvass with considerable vivacity the propriety of enforcing the heated pastry vendor’s proposition and there is no saying what acts of personal aggression they might have committed had not the affray been unexpectedly terminated by the interposition of a new comer ‘what’s the fun ’ said a rather tall thin young man in a green coat emerging suddenly from the coach yard ‘informers ’ shouted the crowd again ‘we are not ’ roared mr pickwick in a tone which to any dispassionate listener carried conviction with it ‘ain’t you though ain’t you ’ said the young man appealing to mr pickwick and making his way through the crowd by the infallible process of elbowing the countenances of its component members that learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the case ‘come along then ’ said he of the green coat lugging mr pickwick after him by main force and talking the whole way here no take your fare and take yourself off respectable gentleman know him well none of your nonsense this way sir where’s your friends all a mistake i see never mind accidents will happen best regulated families never say die down upon your luck pull him _up_ put that in his pipe like the flavour damned rascals ’ and with a lengthened string of similar broken sentences delivered with extraordinary volubility the stranger led the way to the traveller’s waiting room whither he was closely followed by mr pickwick and his disciples ‘here waiter ’ shouted the stranger ringing the bell with tremendous violence ‘glasses round brandy and water hot and strong and sweet and plenty eye damaged sir waiter raw beef steak for the gentleman’s eye nothing like raw beef steak for a bruise sir cold lamp post very good but lamp post inconvenient damned odd standing in the open street half an hour with your eye against a lamp post eh very good ha ha ’ and the stranger without stopping to take breath swallowed at a draught full half a pint of the reeking brandy and water and flung himself into a chair with as much ease as if nothing uncommon had occurred while his three companions were busily engaged in proffering their thanks to their new acquaintance mr pickwick had leisure to examine his costume and appearance he was about the middle height but the thinness of his body and the length of his legs gave him the appearance of being much taller the green coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow tails but had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the stranger for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his wrists it was buttoned closely up to his chin at the imminent hazard of splitting the back and an old stock without a vestige of shirt collar ornamented his neck his scanty black trousers displayed here and there those shiny patches which bespeak long service and were strapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes as if to conceal the dirty white stockings which were nevertheless distinctly visible his long black hair escaped in negligent waves from beneath each side of his old pinched up hat and glimpses of his bare wrists might be observed between the tops of his gloves and the cuffs of his coat sleeves his face was thin and haggard but an indescribable air of jaunty impudence and perfect self possession pervaded the whole man such was the individual on whom mr pickwick gazed through his spectacles which he had fortunately recovered and to whom he proceeded when his friends had exhausted themselves to return in chosen terms his warmest thanks for his recent assistance ‘never mind ’ said the stranger cutting the address very short ‘said enough no more smart chap that cabman handled his fives well but if i’d been your friend in the green jemmy damn me punch his head ‘cod i would pig’s whisper pieman too no gammon ’ this coherent speech was interrupted by the entrance of the rochester coachman to announce that ‘the commodore’ was on the point of starting ‘commodore ’ said the stranger starting up ‘my coach place booked one outside leave you to pay for the brandy and water want change for a five bad silver brummagem buttons won’t do no go eh ’ and he shook his head most knowingly now it so happened that mr pickwick and his three companions had resolved to make rochester their first halting place too and having intimated to their new found acquaintance that they were journeying to the same city they agreed to occupy the seat at the back of the coach where they could all sit together ‘up with you ’ said the stranger assisting mr pickwick on to the roof with so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman’s deportment very materially ‘any luggage sir ’ inquired the coachman ‘who i brown paper parcel here that’s all other luggage gone by water packing cases nailed up big as houses heavy heavy damned heavy ’ replied the stranger as he forced into his pocket as much as he could of the brown paper parcel which presented most suspicious indications of containing one shirt and a handkerchief ‘heads heads take care of your heads ’ cried the loquacious stranger as they came out under the low archway which in those days formed the entrance to the coach yard ‘terrible place dangerous work other day five children mother tall lady eating sandwiches forgot the arch crash knock children look round mother’s head off sandwich in her hand no mouth to put it in head of a family off shocking shocking looking at whitehall sir fine place little window somebody else’s head off there eh sir he didn’t keep a sharp look out enough either eh sir eh ’ ‘i am ruminating ’ said mr pickwick ‘on the strange mutability of human affairs ’ ‘ah i see in at the palace door one day out at the window the next philosopher sir ’ ‘an observer of human nature sir ’ said mr pickwick ‘ah so am i most people are when they’ve little to do and less to get poet sir ’ ‘my friend mr snodgrass has a strong poetic turn ’ said mr pickwick ‘so have i ’ said the stranger ‘epic poem ten thousand lines revolution of july composed it on the spot mars by day apollo by night bang the field piece twang the lyre ’ ‘you were present at that glorious scene sir ’ said mr snodgrass ‘present think i was fired a musket fired with an idea rushed into wine shop wrote it down back again whiz bang another idea wine shop again pen and ink back again cut and slash noble time sir sportsman sir ’ abruptly turning to mr winkle a remarkable instance of the prophetic force of mr jingle’s imagination this dialogue occurring in the year and the revolution in ‘a little sir ’ replied that gentleman ‘fine pursuit sir fine pursuit dogs sir ’ ‘not just now ’ said mr winkle ‘ah you should keep dogs fine animals sagacious creatures dog of my own once pointer surprising instinct out shooting one day entering inclosure whistled dog stopped whistled again ponto no go stock still called him ponto ponto wouldn’t move dog transfixed staring at a board looked up saw an inscription “gamekeeper has orders to shoot all dogs found in this inclosure” wouldn’t pass it wonderful dog valuable dog that very ’ ‘singular circumstance that ’ said mr pickwick ‘will you allow me to make a note of it ’ ‘certainly sir certainly hundred more anecdotes of the same animal fine girl sir’ to mr tracy tupman who had been bestowing sundry anti pickwickian glances on a young lady by the roadside ‘very ’ said mr tupman ‘english girls not so fine as spanish noble creatures jet hair black eyes lovely forms sweet creatures beautiful ’ ‘you have been in spain sir ’ said mr tracy tupman ‘lived there ages ’ ‘many conquests sir ’ inquired mr tupman ‘conquests thousands don bolaro fizzgig grandee only daughter donna christina splendid creature loved me to distraction jealous father high souled daughter handsome englishman donna christina in despair prussic acid stomach pump in my portmanteau operation performed old bolaro in ecstasies consent to our union join hands and floods of tears romantic story very ’ ‘is the lady in england now sir ’ inquired mr tupman on whom the description of her charms had produced a powerful impression ‘dead sir dead ’ said the stranger applying to his right eye the brief remnant of a very old cambric handkerchief ‘never recovered the stomach pump undermined constitution fell a victim ’ ‘and her father ’ inquired the poetic snodgrass ‘remorse and misery ’ replied the stranger ‘sudden disappearance talk of the whole city search made everywhere without success public fountain in the great square suddenly ceased playing weeks elapsed still a stoppage workmen employed to clean it water drawn off father in law discovered sticking head first in the main pipe with a full confession in his right boot took him out and the fountain played away again as well as ever ’ ‘will you allow me to note that little romance down sir ’ said mr snodgrass deeply affected ‘certainly sir certainly fifty more if you like to hear ‘em strange life mine rather curious history not extraordinary but singular ’ in this strain with an occasional glass of ale by way of parenthesis when the coach changed horses did the stranger proceed until they reached rochester bridge by which time the note books both of mr pickwick and mr snodgrass were completely filled with selections from his adventures ‘magnificent ruin ’ said mr augustus snodgrass with all the poetic fervour that distinguished him when they came in sight of the fine old castle ‘what a study for an antiquarian ’ were the very words which fell from mr pickwick’s mouth as he applied his telescope to his eye ‘ah fine place ’ said the stranger ‘glorious pile frowning walls tottering arches dark nooks crumbling staircases old cathedral too earthy smell pilgrims’ feet wore away the old steps little saxon doors confessionals like money takers’ boxes at theatres queer customers those monks popes and lord treasurers and all sorts of old fellows with great red faces and broken noses turning up every day buff jerkins too match locks sarcophagus fine place old legends too strange stories capital ’ and the stranger continued to soliloquise until they reached the bull inn in the high street where the coach stopped ‘do you remain here sir ’ inquired mr nathaniel winkle ‘here not i but you’d better good house nice beds wright’s next house dear very dear half a crown in the bill if you look at the waiter charge you more if you dine at a friend’s than they would if you dined in the coffee room rum fellows very ’ mr winkle turned to mr pickwick and murmured a few words a whisper passed from mr pickwick to mr snodgrass from mr snodgrass to mr tupman and nods of assent were exchanged mr pickwick addressed the stranger ‘you rendered us a very important service this morning sir ’ said he ‘will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner ’ ‘great pleasure not presume to dictate but broiled fowl and mushrooms capital thing what time ’ ‘let me see ’ replied mr pickwick referring to his watch ‘it is now nearly three shall we say five ’ ‘suit me excellently ’ said the stranger ‘five precisely till then care of yourselves ’ and lifting the pinched up hat a few inches from his head and carelessly replacing it very much on one side the stranger with half the brown paper parcel sticking out of his pocket walked briskly up the yard and turned into the high street ‘evidently a traveller in many countries and a close observer of men and things ’ said mr pickwick ‘i should like to see his poem ’ said mr snodgrass ‘i should like to have seen that dog ’ said mr winkle mr tupman said nothing but he thought of donna christina the stomach pump and the fountain and his eyes filled with tears a private sitting room having been engaged bedrooms inspected and dinner ordered the party walked out to view the city and adjoining neighbourhood we do not find from a careful perusal of mr pickwick’s notes of the four towns stroud rochester chatham and brompton that his impressions of their appearance differ in any material point from those of other travellers who have gone over the same ground his general description is easily abridged ‘the principal productions of these towns ’ says mr pickwick ‘appear to be soldiers sailors jews chalk shrimps officers and dockyard men the commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are marine stores hard bake apples flat fish and oysters the streets present a lively and animated appearance occasioned chiefly by the conviviality of the military it is truly delightful to a philanthropic mind to see these gallant men staggering along under the influence of an overflow both of animal and ardent spirits more especially when we remember that the following them about and jesting with them affords a cheap and innocent amusement for the boy population nothing ’ adds mr pickwick ‘can exceed their good humour it was but the day before my arrival that one of them had been most grossly insulted in the house of a publican the barmaid had positively refused to draw him any more liquor in return for which he had merely in playfulness drawn his bayonet and wounded the girl in the shoulder and yet this fine fellow was the very first to go down to the house next morning and express his readiness to overlook the matter and forget what had occurred ‘the consumption of tobacco in these towns ’ continues mr pickwick ‘must be very great and the smell which pervades the streets must be exceedingly delicious to those who are extremely fond of smoking a superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is truly gratifying ’ punctual to five o’clock came the stranger and shortly afterwards the dinner he had divested himself of his brown paper parcel but had made no alteration in his attire and was if possible more loquacious than ever ‘what’s that ’ he inquired as the waiter removed one of the covers ‘soles sir ’ ‘soles ah capital fish all come from london stage coach proprietors get up political dinners carriage of soles dozens of baskets cunning fellows glass of wine sir ’ ‘with pleasure ’ said mr pickwick and the stranger took wine first with him and then with mr snodgrass and then with mr tupman and then with mr winkle and then with the whole party together almost as rapidly as he talked ‘devil of a mess on the staircase waiter ’ said the stranger ‘forms going up carpenters coming down lamps glasses harps what’s going forward ’ ‘ball sir ’ said the waiter ‘assembly eh ’ ‘no sir not assembly sir ball for the benefit of a charity sir ’ ‘many fine women in this town do you know sir ’ inquired mr tupman with great interest ‘splendid capital kent sir everybody knows kent apples cherries hops and women glass of wine sir ’ ‘with great pleasure ’ replied mr tupman the stranger filled and emptied ‘i should very much like to go ’ said mr tupman resuming the subject of the ball ‘very much ’ ‘tickets at the bar sir ’ interposed the waiter ‘half a guinea each sir ’ mr tupman again expressed an earnest wish to be present at the festivity but meeting with no response in the darkened eye of mr snodgrass or the abstracted gaze of mr pickwick he applied himself with great interest to the port wine and dessert which had just been placed on the table the waiter withdrew and the party were left to enjoy the cosy couple of hours succeeding dinner ‘beg your pardon sir ’ said the stranger ‘bottle stands pass it round way of the sun through the button hole no heeltaps ’ and he emptied his glass which he had filled about two minutes before and poured out another with the air of a man who was used to it the wine was passed and a fresh supply ordered the visitor talked the pickwickians listened mr tupman felt every moment more disposed for the ball mr pickwick’s countenance glowed with an expression of universal philanthropy and mr winkle and mr snodgrass fell fast asleep ‘they’re beginning upstairs ’ said the stranger ‘hear the company fiddles tuning now the harp there they go ’ the various sounds which found their way downstairs announced the commencement of the first quadrille ‘how i should like to go ’ said mr tupman again ‘so should i ’ said the stranger ‘confounded luggage heavy smacks nothing to go in odd ain’t it ’ now general benevolence was one of the leading features of the pickwickian theory and no one was more remarkable for the zealous manner in which he observed so noble a principle than mr tracy tupman the number of instances recorded on the transactions of the society in which that excellent man referred objects of charity to the houses of other members for left off garments or pecuniary relief is almost incredible ‘i should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the purpose ’ said mr tracy tupman ‘but you are rather slim and i am ’ ‘rather fat grown up bacchus cut the leaves dismounted from the tub and adopted kersey eh not double distilled but double milled ha ha pass the wine ’ whether mr tupman was somewhat indignant at the peremptory tone in which he was desired to pass the wine which the stranger passed so quickly away or whether he felt very properly scandalised at an influential member of the pickwick club being ignominiously compared to a dismounted bacchus is a fact not yet completely ascertained he passed the wine coughed twice and looked at the stranger for several seconds with a stern intensity as that individual however appeared perfectly collected and quite calm under his searching glance he gradually relaxed and reverted to the subject of the ball ‘i was about to observe sir ’ he said ‘that though my apparel would be too large a suit of my friend mr winkle’s would perhaps fit you better ’ the stranger took mr winkle’s measure with his eye and that feature glistened with satisfaction as he said ‘just the thing ’ mr tupman looked round him the wine which had exerted its somniferous influence over mr snodgrass and mr winkle had stolen upon the senses of mr pickwick that gentleman had gradually passed through the various stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner and its consequences he had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality like a gas lamp in the street with the wind in the pipe he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy then sank so low as to be scarcely discernible after a short interval he had burst out again to enlighten for a moment then flickered with an uncertain staggering sort of light and then gone out altogether his head was sunk upon his bosom and perpetual snoring with a partial choke occasionally were the only audible indications of the great man’s presence the temptation to be present at the ball and to form his first impressions of the beauty of the kentish ladies was strong upon mr tupman the temptation to take the stranger with him was equally great he was wholly unacquainted with the place and its inhabitants and the stranger seemed to possess as great a knowledge of both as if he had lived there from his infancy mr winkle was asleep and mr tupman had had sufficient experience in such matters to know that the moment he awoke he would in the ordinary course of nature roll heavily to bed he was undecided ‘fill your glass and pass the wine ’ said the indefatigable visitor mr tupman did as he was requested and the additional stimulus of the last glass settled his determination ‘winkle’s bedroom is inside mine ’ said mr tupman ‘i couldn’t make him understand what i wanted if i woke him now but i know he has a dress suit in a carpet bag and supposing you wore it to the ball and took it off when we returned i could replace it without troubling him at all about the matter ’ ‘capital ’ said the stranger ‘famous plan damned odd situation fourteen coats in the packing cases and obliged to wear another man’s very good notion that very ’ ‘we must purchase our tickets ’ said mr tupman ‘not worth while splitting a guinea ’ said the stranger ‘toss who shall pay for both i call you spin first time woman woman bewitching woman ’ and down came the sovereign with the dragon called by courtesy a woman uppermost mr tupman rang the bell purchased the tickets and ordered chamber candlesticks in another quarter of an hour the stranger was completely arrayed in a full suit of mr nathaniel winkle’s ‘it’s a new coat ’ said mr tupman as the stranger surveyed himself with great complacency in a cheval glass ‘the first that’s been made with our club button ’ and he called his companions’ attention to the large gilt button which displayed a bust of mr pickwick in the centre and the letters ‘p c ’ on either side ‘“p c ”’ said the stranger ‘queer set out old fellow’s likeness and “p c ” what does “p c ” stand for peculiar coat eh ’ mr tupman with rising indignation and great importance explained the mystic device ‘rather short in the waist ain’t it ’ said the stranger screwing himself round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons which were half way up his back ‘like a general postman’s coat queer coats those made by contract no measuring mysterious dispensations of providence all the short men get long coats all the long men short ones ’ running on in this way mr tupman’s new companion adjusted his dress or rather the dress of mr winkle and accompanied by mr tupman ascended the staircase leading to the ballroom ‘what names sir ’ said the man at the door mr tracy tupman was stepping forward to announce his own titles when the stranger prevented him ‘no names at all ’ and then he whispered mr tupman ‘names won’t do not known very good names in their way but not great ones capital names for a small party but won’t make an impression in public assemblies incog the thing gentlemen from london distinguished foreigners anything ’ the door was thrown open and mr tracy tupman and the stranger entered the ballroom it was a long room with crimson covered benches and wax candles in glass chandeliers the musicians were securely confined in an elevated den and quadrilles were being systematically got through by two or three sets of dancers two card tables were made up in the adjoining card room and two pair of old ladies and a corresponding number of stout gentlemen were executing whist therein the finale concluded the dancers promenaded the room and mr tupman and his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the company ‘charming women ’ said mr tupman ‘wait a minute ’ said the stranger ‘fun presently nobs not come yet queer place dockyard people of upper rank don’t know dockyard people of lower rank dockyard people of lower rank don’t know small gentry small gentry don’t know tradespeople commissioner don’t know anybody ’ ‘who’s that little boy with the light hair and pink eyes in a fancy dress ’ inquired mr tupman ‘hush pray pink eyes fancy dress little boy nonsense ensign th honourable wilmot snipe great family snipes very ’ ‘sir thomas clubber lady clubber and the misses clubber ’ shouted the man at the door in a stentorian voice a great sensation was created throughout the room by the entrance of a tall gentleman in a blue coat and bright buttons a large lady in blue satin and two young ladies on a similar scale in fashionably made dresses of the same hue ‘commissioner head of the yard great man remarkably great man ’ whispered the stranger in mr tupman’s ear as the charitable committee ushered sir thomas clubber and family to the top of the room the honourable wilmot snipe and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to render homage to the misses clubber and sir thomas clubber stood bolt upright and looked majestically over his black kerchief at the assembled company ‘mr smithie mrs smithie and the misses smithie ’ was the next announcement ‘what’s mr smithie ’ inquired mr tracy tupman ‘something in the yard ’ replied the stranger mr smithie bowed deferentially to sir thomas clubber and sir thomas clubber acknowledged the salute with conscious condescension lady clubber took a telescopic view of mrs smithie and family through her eye glass and mrs smithie stared in her turn at mrs somebody else whose husband was not in the dockyard at all ‘colonel bulder mrs colonel bulder and miss bulder ’ were the next arrivals ‘head of the garrison ’ said the stranger in reply to mr tupman’s inquiring look miss bulder was warmly welcomed by the misses clubber the greeting between mrs colonel bulder and lady clubber was of the most affectionate description colonel bulder and sir thomas clubber exchanged snuff boxes and looked very much like a pair of alexander selkirks ‘monarchs of all they surveyed ’ while the aristocracy of the place the bulders and clubbers and snipes were thus preserving their dignity at the upper end of the room the other classes of society were imitating their example in other parts of it the less aristocratic officers of the th devoted themselves to the families of the less important functionaries from the dockyard the solicitors’ wives and the wine merchant’s wife headed another grade the brewer’s wife visited the bulders and mrs tomlinson the post office keeper seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader of the trade party one of the most popular personages in his own circle present was a little fat man with a ring of upright black hair round his head and an extensive bald plain on the top of it doctor slammer surgeon to the th the doctor took snuff with everybody chatted with everybody laughed danced made jokes played whist did everything and was everywhere to these pursuits multifarious as they were the little doctor added a more important one than any he was indefatigable in paying the most unremitting and devoted attention to a little old widow whose rich dress and profusion of ornament bespoke her a most desirable addition to a limited income upon the doctor and the widow the eyes of both mr tupman and his companion had been fixed for some time when the stranger broke silence ‘lots of money old girl pompous doctor not a bad idea good fun ’ were the intelligible sentences which issued from his lips mr tupman looked inquisitively in his face ‘i’ll dance with the widow ’ said the stranger ‘who is she ’ inquired mr tupman ‘don’t know never saw her in all my life cut out the doctor here goes ’ and the stranger forthwith crossed the room and leaning against a mantel piece commenced gazing with an air of respectful and melancholy admiration on the fat countenance of the little old lady mr tupman looked on in mute astonishment the stranger progressed rapidly the little doctor danced with another lady the widow dropped her fan the stranger picked it up and presented it a smile a bow a curtsey a few words of conversation the stranger walked boldly up to and returned with the master of the ceremonies a little introductory pantomime and the stranger and mrs budger took their places in a quadrille the surprise of mr tupman at this summary proceeding great as it was was immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor the stranger was young and the widow was flattered the doctor’s attentions were unheeded by the widow and the doctor’s indignation was wholly lost on his imperturbable rival doctor slammer was paralysed he doctor slammer of the th to be extinguished in a moment by a man whom nobody had ever seen before and whom nobody knew even now doctor slammer doctor slammer of the th rejected impossible it could not be yes it was there they were what introducing his friend could he believe his eyes he looked again and was under the painful necessity of admitting the veracity of his optics mrs budger was dancing with mr tracy tupman there was no mistaking the fact there was the widow before him bouncing bodily here and there with unwonted vigour and mr tracy tupman hopping about with a face expressive of the most intense solemnity dancing as a good many people do as if a quadrille were not a thing to be laughed at but a severe trial to the feelings which it requires inflexible resolution to encounter silently and patiently did the doctor bear all this and all the handings of negus and watching for glasses and darting for biscuits and coquetting that ensued but a few seconds after the stranger had disappeared to lead mrs budger to her carriage he darted swiftly from the room with every particle of his hitherto bottled up indignation effervescing from all parts of his countenance in a perspiration of passion the stranger was returning and mr tupman was beside him he spoke in a low tone and laughed the little doctor thirsted for his life he was exulting he had triumphed ‘sir ’ said the doctor in an awful voice producing a card and retiring into an angle of the passage ‘my name is slammer doctor slammer sir th regiment chatham barracks my card sir my card ’ he would have added more but his indignation choked him ‘ah ’ replied the stranger coolly ‘slammer much obliged polite attention not ill now slammer but when i am knock you up ’ ‘you you’re a shuffler sir ’ gasped the furious doctor ‘a poltroon a coward a liar a a will nothing induce you to give me your card sir ’ ‘oh i see ’ said the stranger half aside ‘negus too strong here liberal landlord very foolish very lemonade much better hot rooms elderly gentlemen suffer for it in the morning cruel cruel ’ and he moved on a step or two ‘you are stopping in this house sir ’ said the indignant little man ‘you are intoxicated now sir you shall hear from me in the morning sir i shall find you out sir i shall find you out ’ ‘rather you found me out than found me at home ’ replied the unmoved stranger doctor slammer looked unutterable ferocity as he fixed his hat on his head with an indignant knock and the stranger and mr tupman ascended to the bedroom of the latter to restore the borrowed plumage to the unconscious winkle that gentleman was fast asleep the restoration was soon made the stranger was extremely jocose and mr tracy tupman being quite bewildered with wine negus lights and ladies thought the whole affair was an exquisite joke his new friend departed and after experiencing some slight difficulty in finding the orifice in his nightcap originally intended for the reception of his head and finally overturning his candlestick in his struggles to put it on mr tracy tupman managed to get into bed by a series of complicated evolutions and shortly afterwards sank into repose seven o’clock had hardly ceased striking on the following morning when mr pickwick’s comprehensive mind was aroused from the state of unconsciousness in which slumber had plunged it by a loud knocking at his chamber door ‘who’s there ’ said mr pickwick starting up in bed ‘boots sir ’ ‘what do you want ’ ‘please sir can you tell me which gentleman of your party wears a bright blue dress coat with a gilt button with “p c ” on it ’ ‘it’s been given out to brush ’ thought mr pickwick ‘and the man has forgotten whom it belongs to ’ mr winkle ’ he called out ‘next room but two on the right hand ’ ‘thank’ee sir ’ said the boots and away he went ‘what’s the matter ’ cried mr tupman as a loud knocking at his door roused him from his oblivious repose ‘can i speak to mr winkle sir ’ replied boots from the outside ‘winkle winkle ’ shouted mr tupman calling into the inner room ‘hollo ’ replied a faint voice from within the bed clothes ‘you’re wanted some one at the door ’ and having exerted himself to articulate thus much mr tracy tupman turned round and fell fast asleep again ‘wanted ’ said mr winkle hastily jumping out of bed and putting on a few articles of clothing ‘wanted at this distance from town who on earth can want me ’ ‘gentleman in the coffee room sir ’ replied the boots as mr winkle opened the door and confronted him ‘gentleman says he’ll not detain you a moment sir but he can take no denial ’ ‘very odd ’ said mr winkle ‘i’ll be down directly ’ he hurriedly wrapped himself in a travelling shawl and dressing gown and proceeded downstairs an old woman and a couple of waiters were cleaning the coffee room and an officer in undress uniform was looking out of the window he turned round as mr winkle entered and made a stiff inclination of the head having ordered the attendants to retire and closed the door very carefully he said ‘mr winkle i presume ’ ‘my name is winkle sir ’ ‘you will not be surprised sir when i inform you that i have called here this morning on behalf of my friend doctor slammer of the th ’ ‘doctor slammer ’ said mr winkle ‘doctor slammer he begged me to express his opinion that your conduct of last evening was of a description which no gentleman could endure and’ he added ‘which no one gentleman would pursue towards another ’ mr winkle’s astonishment was too real and too evident to escape the observation of doctor slammer’s friend he therefore proceeded ‘my friend doctor slammer requested me to add that he was firmly persuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening and possibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of he commissioned me to say that should this be pleaded as an excuse for your behaviour he will consent to accept a written apology to be penned by you from my dictation ’ ‘a written apology ’ repeated mr winkle in the most emphatic tone of amazement possible ‘of course you know the alternative ’ replied the visitor coolly ‘were you intrusted with this message to me by name ’ inquired mr winkle whose intellects were hopelessly confused by this extraordinary conversation ‘i was not present myself ’ replied the visitor ‘and in consequence of your firm refusal to give your card to doctor slammer i was desired by that gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat a bright blue dress coat with a gilt button displaying a bust and the letters “p c ”’ mr winkle actually staggered with astonishment as he heard his own costume thus minutely described doctor slammer’s friend proceeded ‘from the inquiries i made at the bar just now i was convinced that the owner of the coat in question arrived here with three gentlemen yesterday afternoon i immediately sent up to the gentleman who was described as appearing the head of the party and he at once referred me to you ’ if the principal tower of rochester castle had suddenly walked from its foundation and stationed itself opposite the coffee room window mr winkle’s surprise would have been as nothing compared with the profound astonishment with which he had heard this address his first impression was that his coat had been stolen ‘will you allow me to detain you one moment ’ said he ‘certainly ’ replied the unwelcome visitor mr winkle ran hastily upstairs and with a trembling hand opened the bag there was the coat in its usual place but exhibiting on a close inspection evident tokens of having been worn on the preceding night ‘it must be so ’ said mr winkle letting the coat fall from his hands ‘i took too much wine after dinner and have a very vague recollection of walking about the streets and smoking a cigar afterwards the fact is i was very drunk i must have changed my coat gone somewhere and insulted somebody i have no doubt of it and this message is the terrible consequence ’ saying which mr winkle retraced his steps in the direction of the coffee room with the gloomy and dreadful resolve of accepting the challenge of the warlike doctor slammer and abiding by the worst consequences that might ensue to this determination mr winkle was urged by a variety of considerations the first of which was his reputation with the club he had always been looked up to as a high authority on all matters of amusement and dexterity whether offensive defensive or inoffensive and if on this very first occasion of being put to the test he shrunk back from the trial beneath his leader’s eye his name and standing were lost for ever besides he remembered to have heard it frequently surmised by the uninitiated in such matters that by an understood arrangement between the seconds the pistols were seldom loaded with ball and furthermore he reflected that if he applied to mr snodgrass to act as his second and depicted the danger in glowing terms that gentleman might possibly communicate the intelligence to mr pickwick who would certainly lose no time in transmitting it to the local authorities and thus prevent the killing or maiming of his follower such were his thoughts when he returned to the coffee room and intimated his intention of accepting the doctor’s challenge ‘will you refer me to a friend to arrange the time and place of meeting ’ said the officer ‘quite unnecessary ’ replied mr winkle ‘name them to me and i can procure the attendance of a friend afterwards ’ ‘shall we say sunset this evening ’ inquired the officer in a careless tone ‘very good ’ replied mr winkle thinking in his heart it was very bad ‘you know fort pitt ’ ‘yes i saw it yesterday ’ ‘if you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders the trench take the foot path to the left when you arrive at an angle of the fortification and keep straight on till you see me i will precede you to a secluded place where the affair can be conducted without fear of interruption ’ ‘fear of interruption ’ thought mr winkle ‘nothing more to arrange i think ’ said the officer ‘i am not aware of anything more ’ replied mr winkle ‘good morning ’ ‘good morning ’ and the officer whistled a lively air as he strode away that morning’s breakfast passed heavily off mr tupman was not in a condition to rise after the unwonted dissipation of the previous night mr snodgrass appeared to labour under a poetical depression of spirits and even mr pickwick evinced an unusual attachment to silence and soda water mr winkle eagerly watched his opportunity it was not long wanting mr snodgrass proposed a visit to the castle and as mr winkle was the only other member of the party disposed to walk they went out together ‘snodgrass ’ said mr winkle when they had turned out of the public street ’snodgrass my dear fellow can i rely upon your secrecy ’ as he said this he most devoutly and earnestly hoped he could not ‘you can ’ replied mr snodgrass ‘hear me swear ’ ‘no no ’ interrupted winkle terrified at the idea of his companion’s unconsciously pledging himself not to give information ‘don’t swear don’t swear it’s quite unnecessary ’ mr snodgrass dropped the hand which he had in the spirit of poesy raised towards the clouds as he made the above appeal and assumed an attitude of attention ‘i want your assistance my dear fellow in an affair of honour ’ said mr winkle ‘you shall have it ’ replied mr snodgrass clasping his friend’s hand ‘with a doctor doctor slammer of the th ’ said mr winkle wishing to make the matter appear as solemn as possible ‘an affair with an officer seconded by another officer at sunset this evening in a lonely field beyond fort pitt ’ ‘i will attend you ’ said mr snodgrass he was astonished but by no means dismayed it is extraordinary how cool any party but the principal can be in such cases mr winkle had forgotten this he had judged of his friend’s feelings by his own ‘the consequences may be dreadful ’ said mr winkle ‘i hope not ’ said mr snodgrass ‘the doctor i believe is a very good shot ’ said mr winkle ‘most of these military men are ’ observed mr snodgrass calmly ‘but so are you ain’t you ’ mr winkle replied in the affirmative and perceiving that he had not alarmed his companion sufficiently changed his ground ‘snodgrass ’ he said in a voice tremulous with emotion ‘if i fall you will find in a packet which i shall place in your hands a note for my for my father ’ this attack was a failure also mr snodgrass was affected but he undertook the delivery of the note as readily as if he had been a twopenny postman ‘if i fall ’ said mr winkle ‘or if the doctor falls you my dear friend will be tried as an accessory before the fact shall i involve my friend in transportation possibly for life ’ mr snodgrass winced a little at this but his heroism was invincible ‘in the cause of friendship ’ he fervently exclaimed ‘i would brave all dangers ’ how mr winkle cursed his companion’s devoted friendship internally as they walked silently along side by side for some minutes each immersed in his own meditations the morning was wearing away he grew desperate ‘snodgrass ’ he said stopping suddenly ‘do not let me be balked in this matter do not give information to the local authorities do not obtain the assistance of several peace officers to take either me or doctor slammer of the th regiment at present quartered in chatham barracks into custody and thus prevent this duel i say do not ’ mr snodgrass seized his friend’s hand warmly as he enthusiastically replied ‘not for worlds ’ a thrill passed over mr winkle’s frame as the conviction that he had nothing to hope from his friend’s fears and that he was destined to become an animated target rushed forcibly upon him the state of the case having been formally explained to mr snodgrass and a case of satisfactory pistols with the satisfactory accompaniments of powder ball and caps having been hired from a manufacturer in rochester the two friends returned to their inn mr winkle to ruminate on the approaching struggle and mr snodgrass to arrange the weapons of war and put them into proper order for immediate use it was a dull and heavy evening when they again sallied forth on their awkward errand mr winkle was muffled up in a huge cloak to escape observation and mr snodgrass bore under his the instruments of destruction ‘have you got everything ’ said mr winkle in an agitated tone ‘everything ’ replied mr snodgrass ‘plenty of ammunition in case the shots don’t take effect there’s a quarter of a pound of powder in the case and i have got two newspapers in my pocket for the loadings ’ these were instances of friendship for which any man might reasonably feel most grateful the presumption is that the gratitude of mr winkle was too powerful for utterance as he said nothing but continued to walk on rather slowly ‘we are in excellent time ’ said mr snodgrass as they climbed the fence of the first field ‘the sun is just going down ’ mr winkle looked up at the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability of his ‘going down’ himself before long ‘there’s the officer ’ exclaimed mr winkle after a few minutes walking ‘where ’ said mr snodgrass ‘there the gentleman in the blue cloak ’ mr snodgrass looked in the direction indicated by the forefinger of his friend and observed a figure muffled up as he had described the officer evinced his consciousness of their presence by slightly beckoning with his hand and the two friends followed him at a little distance as he walked away the evening grew more dull every moment and a melancholy wind sounded through the deserted fields like a distant giant whistling for his house dog the sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the feelings of mr winkle he started as they passed the angle of the trench it looked like a colossal grave the officer turned suddenly from the path and after climbing a paling and scaling a hedge entered a secluded field two gentlemen were waiting in it one was a little fat man with black hair and the other a portly personage in a braided surtout was sitting with perfect equanimity on a camp stool ‘the other party and a surgeon i suppose ’ said mr snodgrass ‘take a drop of brandy ’ mr winkle seized the wicker bottle which his friend proffered and took a lengthened pull at the exhilarating liquid ‘my friend sir mr snodgrass ’ said mr winkle as the officer approached doctor slammer’s friend bowed and produced a case similar to that which mr snodgrass carried ‘we have nothing further to say sir i think ’ he coldly remarked as he opened the case ‘an apology has been resolutely declined ’ ‘nothing sir ’ said mr snodgrass who began to feel rather uncomfortable himself ‘will you step forward ’ said the officer ‘certainly ’ replied mr snodgrass the ground was measured and preliminaries arranged ‘you will find these better than your own ’ said the opposite second producing his pistols ‘you saw me load them do you object to use them ’ ‘certainly not ’ replied mr snodgrass the offer relieved him from considerable embarrassment for his previous notions of loading a pistol were rather vague and undefined ‘we may place our men then i think ’ observed the officer with as much indifference as if the principals were chess men and the seconds players ‘i think we may ’ replied mr snodgrass who would have assented to any proposition because he knew nothing about the matter the officer crossed to doctor slammer and mr snodgrass went up to mr winkle ‘it’s all ready ’ said he offering the pistol ‘give me your cloak ’ ‘you have got the packet my dear fellow ’ said poor winkle ‘all right ’ said mr snodgrass ‘be steady and wing him ’ it occurred to mr winkle that this advice was very like that which bystanders invariably give to the smallest boy in a street fight namely ‘go in and win’ an admirable thing to recommend if you only know how to do it he took off his cloak however in silence it always took a long time to undo that cloak and accepted the pistol the seconds retired the gentleman on the camp stool did the same and the belligerents approached each other mr winkle was always remarkable for extreme humanity it is conjectured that his unwillingness to hurt a fellow creature intentionally was the cause of his shutting his eyes when he arrived at the fatal spot and that the circumstance of his eyes being closed prevented his observing the very extraordinary and unaccountable demeanour of doctor slammer that gentleman started stared retreated rubbed his eyes stared again and finally shouted ‘stop stop ’ ‘what’s all this ’ said doctor slammer as his friend and mr snodgrass came running up ‘that’s not the man ’ ‘not the man ’ said doctor slammer’s second ‘not the man ’ said mr snodgrass ‘not the man ’ said the gentleman with the camp stool in his hand ‘certainly not ’ replied the little doctor ‘that’s not the person who insulted me last night ’ ‘very extraordinary ’ exclaimed the officer ‘very ’ said the gentleman with the camp stool ‘the only question is whether the gentleman being on the ground must not be considered as a matter of form to be the individual who insulted our friend doctor slammer yesterday evening whether he is really that individual or not ’ and having delivered this suggestion with a very sage and mysterious air the man with the camp stool took a large pinch of snuff and looked profoundly round with the air of an authority in such matters now mr winkle had opened his eyes and his ears too when he heard his adversary call out for a cessation of hostilities and perceiving by what he had afterwards said that there was beyond all question some mistake in the matter he at once foresaw the increase of reputation he should inevitably acquire by concealing the real motive of his coming out he therefore stepped boldly forward and said ‘i am not the person i know it ’ ‘then that ’ said the man with the camp stool ‘is an affront to doctor slammer and a sufficient reason for proceeding immediately ’ ‘pray be quiet payne ’ said the doctor’s second ‘why did you not communicate this fact to me this morning sir ’ ‘to be sure to be sure ’ said the man with the camp stool indignantly ‘i entreat you to be quiet payne ’ said the other ‘may i repeat my question sir ’ ‘because sir ’ replied mr winkle who had had time to deliberate upon his answer ‘because sir you described an intoxicated and ungentlemanly person as wearing a coat which i have the honour not only to wear but to have invented the proposed uniform sir of the pickwick club in london the honour of that uniform i feel bound to maintain and i therefore without inquiry accepted the challenge which you offered me ’ ‘my dear sir ’ said the good humoured little doctor advancing with extended hand ‘i honour your gallantry permit me to say sir that i highly admire your conduct and extremely regret having caused you the inconvenience of this meeting to no purpose ’ ‘i beg you won’t mention it sir ’ said mr winkle ‘i shall feel proud of your acquaintance sir ’ said the little doctor ‘it will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you sir ’ replied mr winkle thereupon the doctor and mr winkle shook hands and then mr winkle and lieutenant tappleton the doctor’s second and then mr winkle and the man with the camp stool and finally mr winkle and mr snodgrass the last named gentleman in an excess of admiration at the noble conduct of his heroic friend ‘i think we may adjourn ’ said lieutenant tappleton ‘certainly ’ added the doctor ‘unless ’ interposed the man with the camp stool ‘unless mr winkle feels himself aggrieved by the challenge in which case i submit he has a right to satisfaction ’ mr winkle with great self denial expressed himself quite satisfied already ‘or possibly ’ said the man with the camp stool ‘the gentleman’s second may feel himself affronted with some observations which fell from me at an early period of this meeting if so i shall be happy to give him satisfaction immediately ’ mr snodgrass hastily professed himself very much obliged with the handsome offer of the gentleman who had spoken last which he was only induced to decline by his entire contentment with the whole proceedings the two seconds adjusted the cases and the whole party left the ground in a much more lively manner than they had proceeded to it ‘do you remain long here ’ inquired doctor slammer of mr winkle as they walked on most amicably together ‘i think we shall leave here the day after to morrow ’ was the reply ‘i trust i shall have the pleasure of seeing you and your friend at my rooms and of spending a pleasant evening with you after this awkward mistake ’ said the little doctor ‘are you disengaged this evening ’ ‘we have some friends here ’ replied mr winkle ‘and i should not like to leave them to night perhaps you and your friend will join us at the bull ’ ‘with great pleasure ’ said the little doctor ‘will ten o’clock be too late to look in for half an hour ’ ‘oh dear no ’ said mr winkle ‘i shall be most happy to introduce you to my friends mr pickwick and mr tupman ’ ‘it will give me great pleasure i am sure ’ replied doctor slammer little suspecting who mr tupman was ‘you will be sure to come ’ said mr snodgrass ‘oh certainly ’ by this time they had reached the road cordial farewells were exchanged and the party separated doctor slammer and his friends repaired to the barracks and mr winkle accompanied by mr snodgrass returned to their inn'),\n",

       "  'a tramp abroad part i the knighted knave of bergen one day it occurred to me that it had been many years since the world had been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake a journey through europe on foot after much thought i decided that i was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle so i determined to do it this was in march i looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the capacity of agent and finally hired a mr harris for this service it was also my purpose to study art while in europe mr harris was in sympathy with me in this he was as much of an enthusiast in art as i was and not less anxious to learn to paint i desired to learn the german language so did harris toward the middle of april we sailed in the holsatia captain brandt and had a very pleasant trip indeed after a brief rest at hamburg we made preparations for a long pedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather but at the last moment we changed the program for private reasons and took the express train we made a short halt at frankfort on the main and found it an interesting city i would have liked to visit the birthplace of gutenburg but it could not be done as no memorandum of the site of the house has been kept so we spent an hour in the goethe mansion instead the city permits this house to belong to private parties instead of gracing and dignifying herself with the honor of possessing and protecting it frankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of being the place where the following incident occurred charlemagne while chasing the saxons as he said or being chased by them as they said arrived at the bank of the river at dawn in a fog the enemy were either before him or behind him but in any case he wanted to get across very badly he would have given anything for a guide but none was to be had presently he saw a deer followed by her young approach the water he watched her judging that she would seek a ford and he was right she waded over and the army followed so a great frankish victory or defeat was gained or avoided and in order to commemorate the episode charlemagne commanded a city to be built there which he named frankfort the ford of the franks none of the other cities where this event happened were named for it this is good evidence that frankfort was the first place it occurred at frankfort has another distinction it is the birthplace of the german alphabet or at least of the german word for alphabet buchstaben they say that the first movable types were made on birch sticks buchstabe hence the name i was taught a lesson in political economy in frankfort i had brought from home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars by way of experiment i stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street took four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars and laid down a silver piece worth cents the man gave me cents change in frankfort everybody wears clean clothes and i think we noticed that this strange thing was the case in hamburg too and in the villages along the road even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient quarters of frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule the little children of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a body’s lap and as for the uniforms of the soldiers they were newness and brightness carried to perfection one could never detect a smirch or a grain of dust upon them the street car conductors and drivers wore pretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox and their manners were as fine as their clothes in one of the shops i had the luck to stumble upon a book which has charmed me nearly to death it is entitled the legends of the rhine from basle to rotterdam by f j kiefer translated by l w garnham b a all tourists mention the rhine legends in that sort of way which quietly pretends that the mentioner has been familiar with them all his life and that the reader cannot possibly be ignorant of them but no tourist ever tells them so this little book fed me in a very hungry place and i in my turn intend to feed my reader with one or two little lunches from the same larder i shall not mar garnham’s translation by meddling with its english for the most toothsome thing about it is its quaint fashion of building english sentences on the german plan and punctuating them accordingly to no plan at all in the devoted to “legends of frankfort ” i find the following “the knave of bergen” “in frankfort at the romer was a great mask ball at the coronation festival and in the illuminated saloon the clanging music invited to dance and splendidly appeared the rich toilets and charms of the ladies and the festively costumed princes and knights all seemed pleasure joy and roguish gaiety only one of the numerous guests had a gloomy exterior but exactly the black armor in which he walked about excited general attention and his tall figure as well as the noble propriety of his movements attracted especially the regards of the ladies who the knight was nobody could guess for his vizier was well closed and nothing made him recognizable proud and yet modest he advanced to the empress bowed on one knee before her seat and begged for the favor of a waltz with the queen of the festival and she allowed his request with light and graceful steps he danced through the long saloon with the sovereign who thought never to have found a more dexterous and excellent dancer but also by the grace of his manner and fine conversation he knew to win the queen and she graciously accorded him a second dance for which he begged a third and a fourth as well as others were not refused him how all regarded the happy dancer how many envied him the high favor how increased curiosity who the masked knight could be “also the emperor became more and more excited with curiosity and with great suspense one awaited the hour when according to mask law each masked guest must make himself known this moment came but although all other unmasked the secret knight still refused to allow his features to be seen till at last the queen driven by curiosity and vexed at the obstinate refusal commanded him to open his vizier he opened it and none of the high ladies and knights knew him but from the crowded spectators officials advanced who recognized the black dancer and horror and terror spread in the saloon as they said who the supposed knight was it was the executioner of bergen but glowing with rage the king commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death who had ventured to dance with the queen so disgraced the empress and insulted the crown the culpable threw himself at the emperor and said “‘indeed i have heavily sinned against all noble guests assembled here but most heavily against you my sovereign and my queen the queen is insulted by my haughtiness equal to treason but no punishment even blood will not be able to wash out the disgrace which you have suffered by me therefore oh king allow me to propose a remedy to efface the shame and to render it as if not done draw your sword and knight me then i will throw down my gauntlet to everyone who dares to speak disrespectfully of my king ’ “the emperor was surprised at this bold proposal however it appeared the wisest to him ‘you are a knave ’ he replied after a moment’s consideration ‘however your advice is good and displays prudence as your offense shows adventurous courage well then ’ and gave him the knight stroke ‘so i raise you to nobility who begged for grace for your offense now kneels before me rise as knight knavish you have acted and knave of bergen shall you be called henceforth ’ and gladly the black knight rose three cheers were given in honor of the emperor and loud cries of joy testified the approbation with which the queen danced still once with the knave of bergen ” ii heidelberg landing a monarch at heidelberg we stopped at a hotel by the railway station next morning as we sat in my room waiting for breakfast to come up we got a good deal interested in something which was going on over the way in front of another hotel first the personage who is called the portier who is not the porter but is a sort of first mate of a hotel see appendix a appeared at the door in a spick and span new blue cloth uniform decorated with shining brass buttons and with bands of gold lace around his cap and wristbands and he wore white gloves too he shed an official glance upon the situation and then began to give orders two women servants came out with pails and brooms and brushes and gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing meanwhile two others scrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door beyond these we could see some men servants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase this carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and banged and swept out of it then brought back and put down again the brass stair rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to their places now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming plants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the base of the staircase other servants adorned all the balconies of the various stories with flowers and banners others ascended to the roof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there now came some more chamber maids and retouched the sidewalk and afterward wiped the marble steps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather brushes now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the marble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone the portier cast his eye along it and found it was not absolutely straight he commanded it to be straightened the servants made the effort made several efforts in fact but the portier was not satisfied he finally had it taken up and then he put it down himself and got it right at this stage of the proceedings a narrow bright red carpet was unrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the curbstone along the center of the black carpet this red path cost the portier more trouble than even the black one had done but he patiently fixed and refixed it until it was exactly right and lay precisely in the middle of the black carpet in new york these performances would have gathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely interested spectators but here it only captured an audience of half a dozen little boys who stood in a row across the pavement some with their school knapsacks on their backs and their hands in their pockets others with arms full of bundles and all absorbed in the show occasionally one of them skipped irreverently over the carpet and took up a position on the other side this always visibly annoyed the portier now came a waiting interval the landlord in plain clothes and bareheaded placed himself on the bottom marble step abreast the portier who stood on the other end of the same steps six or eight waiters gloved bareheaded and wearing their whitest linen their whitest cravats and their finest swallow tails grouped themselves about these chiefs but leaving the carpetway clear nobody moved or spoke any more but only waited in a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard and immediately groups of people began to gather in the street two or three open carriages arrived and deposited some maids of honor and some male officials at the hotel presently another open carriage brought the grand duke of baden a stately man in uniform who wore the handsome brass mounted steel spiked helmet of the army on his head last came the empress of germany and the grand duchess of baden in a closed carriage these passed through the low bowing groups of servants and disappeared in the hotel exhibiting to us only the backs of their heads and then the show was over it appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a ship but as to heidelberg the weather was growing pretty warm very warm in fact so we left the valley and took quarters at the schloss hotel on the hill above the castle heidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorge a gorge the shape of a shepherd’s crook if one looks up it he perceives that it is about straight for a mile and a half then makes a sharp curve to the right and disappears this gorge along whose bottom pours the swift neckar is confined between or cloven through a couple of long steep ridges a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits with the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under cultivation these ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge and form two bold and conspicuous headlands with heidelberg nestling between them from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the rhine valley and into this expanse the neckar goes wandering in shining curves and is presently lost to view now if one turns and looks up the gorge once more he will see the schloss hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the neckar a precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with foliage that no glimpse of the rock appears the building seems very airily situated it has the appearance of being on a shelf half way up the wooded mountainside and as it is remote and isolated and very white it makes a strong mark against the lofty leafy rampart at its back this hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty and one which might be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a commanding situation this feature may be described as a series of glass enclosed parlors clinging to the outside of the house one against each and every bed chamber and drawing room they are like long narrow high ceiled bird cages hung against the building my room was a corner room and had two of these things a north one and a west one from the north cage one looks up the neckar gorge from the west one he looks down it this last affords the most extensive view and it is one of the loveliest that can be imagined too out of a billowy upheaval of vivid green foliage a rifle shot removed rises the huge ruin of heidelberg castle see appendix b with empty window arches ivy mailed battlements moldering towers the lear of inanimate nature deserted discrowned beaten by the storms but royal still and beautiful it is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly strike the leafy declivity at the castle’s base and dash up it and drench it as with a luminous spray while the adjacent groves are in deep shadow behind the castle swells a great dome shaped hill forest clad and beyond that a nobler and loftier one the castle looks down upon the compact brown roofed town and from the town two picturesque old bridges span the river now the view broadens through the gateway of the sentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide rhine plain which stretches away softly and richly tinted grows gradually and dreamily indistinct and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon i have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm about it as this one gives the first night we were there we went to bed and to sleep early but i awoke at the end of two or three hours and lay a comfortable while listening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony windows i took it to be rain but it turned out to be only the murmur of the restless neckar tumbling over her dikes and dams far below in the gorge i got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful sight away down on the level under the black mass of the castle the town lay stretched along the river its intricate cobweb of streets jeweled with twinkling lights there were rows of lights on the bridges these flung lances of light upon the water in the black shadows of the arches and away at the extremity of all this fairy spectacle blinked and glowed a massed multitude of gas jets which seemed to cover acres of ground it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread out there i did not know before that a half mile of sextuple railway tracks could be made such an adornment one thinks heidelberg by day with its surroundings is the last possibility of the beautiful but when he sees heidelberg by night a fallen milky way with that glittering railway constellation pinned to the border he requires time to consider upon the verdict one never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all these lofty neckar hills to their tops the great deeps of a boundless forest have a beguiling and impressive charm in any country but german legends and fairy tales have given these an added charm they have peopled all that region with gnomes and dwarfs and all sorts of mysterious and uncanny creatures at the time i am writing of i had been reading so much of this literature that sometimes i was not sure but i was beginning to believe in the gnomes and fairies as realities one afternoon i got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel and presently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk and kobolds and enchanted folk and the rest of the pleasant legendary stuff and so by stimulating my fancy i finally got to imagining i glimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the columned aisles of the forest it was a place which was peculiarly meet for the occasion it was a pine wood with so thick and soft a carpet of brown needles that one’s footfall made no more sound than if he were treading on wool the tree trunks were as round and straight and smooth as pillars and stood close together they were bare of branches to a point about twenty five feet above ground and from there upward so thick with boughs that not a ray of sunlight could pierce through the world was bright with sunshine outside but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in there and also a deep silence so profound that i seemed to hear my own breathings when i had stood ten minutes thinking and imagining and getting my spirit in tune with the place and in the right mood to enjoy the supernatural a raven suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head it made me start and then i was angry because i started i looked up and the creature was sitting on a limb right over me looking down at me i felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which one feels when he finds that a human stranger has been clandestinely inspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him i eyed the raven and the raven eyed me nothing was said during some seconds then the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point of observation lifted his wings stuck his head far down below his shoulders toward me and croaked again a croak with a distinctly insulting expression about it if he had spoken in english he could not have said any more plainly than he did say in raven “well what do you want here ” i felt as foolish as if i had been caught in some mean act by a responsible being and reproved for it however i made no reply i would not bandy words with a raven the adversary waited a while with his shoulders still lifted his head thrust down between them and his keen bright eye fixed on me then he threw out two or three more insults which i could not understand further than that i knew a portion of them consisted of language not used in church i still made no reply now the adversary raised his head and called there was an answering croak from a little distance in the wood evidently a croak of inquiry the adversary explained with enthusiasm and the other raven dropped everything and came the two sat side by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and offensively as two great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug the thing became more and more embarrassing they called in another friend this was too much i saw that they had the advantage of me and so i concluded to get out of the scrape by walking out of it they enjoyed my defeat as much as any low white people could have done they craned their necks and laughed at me for a raven can laugh just like a man they squalled insulting remarks after me as long as they could see me they were nothing but ravens i knew that what they thought of me could be a matter of no consequence and yet when even a raven shouts after you “what a hat ” “oh pull down your vest ” and that sort of thing it hurts you and humiliates you and there is no getting around it with fine reasoning and pretty arguments animals talk to each other of course there can be no question about that but i suppose there are very few people who can understand them i never knew but one man who could i knew he could however because he told me so himself he was a middle aged simple hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner of california among the woods and mountains a good many years and had studied the ways of his only neighbors the beasts and the birds until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made this was jim baker according to jim baker some animals have only a limited education and some use only simple words and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure whereas certain other animals have a large vocabulary a fine command of language and a ready and fluent delivery consequently these latter talk a great deal they like it they are so conscious of their talent and they enjoy “showing off ” baker said that after long and careful observation he had come to the conclusion that the bluejays were the best talkers he had found among birds and beasts said he “there’s more to a bluejay than any other creature he has got more moods and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures and mind you whatever a bluejay feels he can put into language and no mere commonplace language either but rattling out and out book talk and bristling with metaphor too just bristling and as for command of language why you never see a bluejay get stuck for a word no man ever did they just boil out of him and another thing i’ve noticed a good deal and there’s no bird or cow or anything that uses as good grammar as a bluejay you may say a cat uses good grammar well a cat does but you let a cat get excited once you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed nights and you’ll hear grammar that will give you the lockjaw ignorant people think it’s the noise which fighting cats make that is so aggravating but it ain’t so it’s the sickening grammar they use now i’ve never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom and when they do they are as ashamed as a human they shut right down and leave “you may call a jay a bird well so he is in a measure but he’s got feathers on him and don’t belong to no church perhaps but otherwise he is just as much human as you be and i’ll tell you for why a jay’s gifts and instincts and feelings and interests cover the whole ground a jay hasn’t got any more principle than a congressman a jay will lie a jay will steal a jay will deceive a jay will betray and four times out of five a jay will go back on his solemnest promise the sacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you can’t cram into no bluejay’s head now on top of all this there’s another thing a jay can out swear any gentleman in the mines you think a cat can swear well a cat can but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his reserve powers and where is your cat don’t talk to me i know too much about this thing in the one little particular of scolding just good clean out and out scolding a bluejay can lay over anything human or divine yes sir a jay is everything that a man is a jay can cry a jay can laugh a jay can feel shame a jay can reason and plan and discuss a jay likes gossip and scandal a jay has got a sense of humor a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do maybe better if a jay ain’t human he better take in his sign that’s all now i’m going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays ”'),\n",

       "  'adventures of huckleberry finn i you don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer but that ain’t no matter that book was made by mr mark and he told the truth mainly there was things which he stretched but mainly he told the truth that is nothing i never seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was aunt polly or the widow or maybe mary aunt polly tom’s aunt polly she is and mary and the widow douglas is all told about in that book which is mostly a true book with some stretchers as i said before now the way that the book winds up is this tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich we got six thousand dollars apiece all gold it was an awful sight of money when it was piled up well judge thatcher he took it and put it out at interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round more than a body could tell what to do with the widow douglas she took me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways and so when i couldn’t stand it no longer i lit out i got into my old rags and my sugar hogshead again and was free and satisfied but tom sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if i would go back to the widow and be respectable so i went back the widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she called me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm by it she put me in them new clothes again and i couldn’t do nothing but sweat and sweat and feel all cramped up well then the old thing commenced again the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time when you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals though there warn’t really anything the matter with them that is nothing only everything was cooked by itself in a barrel of odds and ends it is different things get mixed up and the juice kind of swaps around and the things go better after supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and the bulrushers and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time so then i didn’t care no more about him because i don’t take no stock in dead people pretty soon i wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me but she wouldn’t she said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean and i must try to not do it any more that is just the way with some people they get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it here she was a bothering about moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it and she took snuff too of course that was all right because she done it herself her sister miss watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a spelling book she worked me middling hard for about an hour and then the widow made her ease up i couldn’t stood it much longer then for an hour it was deadly dull and i was fidgety miss watson would say “don’t put your feet up there huckleberry ” and “don’t scrunch up like that huckleberry set up straight ” and pretty soon she would say “don’t gap and stretch like that huckleberry why don’t you try to behave ” then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wished i was there she got mad then but i didn’t mean no harm all i wanted was to go somewheres all i wanted was a change i warn’t particular she said it was wicked to say what i said said she wouldn’t say it for the whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place well i couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going so i made up my mind i wouldn’t try for it but i never said so because it would only make trouble and wouldn’t do no good now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good place she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing forever and ever so i didn’t think much of it but i never said so i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer would go there and she said not by a considerable sight i was glad about that because i wanted him and me to be together miss watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and then everybody was off to bed i went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table then i set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful but it warn’t no use i felt so lonesome i most wished i was dead the stars were shining and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful and i heard an owl away off who whooing about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die and the wind was trying to whisper something to me and i couldn’t make out what it was and so it made the cold shivers run over me then away out in the woods i heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood and so can’t rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving i got so down hearted and scared i did wish i had some company pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder and i flipped it off and it lit in the candle and before i could budge it was all shriveled up i didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i was scared and most shook the clothes off of me i got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time and then i tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away but i hadn’t no confidence you do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that you’ve found instead of nailing it up over the door but i hadn’t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed a spider i set down again a shaking all over and got out my pipe for a smoke for the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldn’t know well after a long time i heard the clock away off in the town go boom boom boom twelve licks and all still again stiller than ever pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees something was a stirring i set still and listened directly i could just barely hear a “me yow me yow ” down there that was good says i “me yow me yow ” as soft as i could and then i put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed then i slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enough there was tom sawyer waiting for me ii we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow’s garden stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape our heads when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise we scrouched down and laid still miss watson’s big nigger named jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty clear because there was a light behind him he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute listening then he says “who dah ” he listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us we could a touched him nearly well likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn’t a sound and we all there so close together there was a place on my ankle that got to itching but i dasn’t scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right between my shoulders seemed like i’d die if i couldn’t scratch well i’ve noticed that thing plenty times since if you are with the quality or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t sleepy if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places pretty soon jim says “say who is you whar is you dog my cats ef i didn’ hear sumf’n well i know what i’s gwyne to do i’s gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin ” so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom he leaned his back up against a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine my nose begun to itch it itched till the tears come into my eyes but i dasn’t scratch then it begun to itch on the inside next i got to itching underneath i didn’t know how i was going to set still this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes but it seemed a sight longer than that i was itching in eleven different places now i reckoned i couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try just then jim begun to breathe heavy next he begun to snore and then i was pretty soon comfortable again tom he made a sign to me kind of a little noise with his mouth and we went creeping away on our hands and knees when we was ten foot off tom whispered to me and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun but i said no he might wake and make a disturbance and then they’d find out i warn’t in then tom said he hadn’t got candles enough and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more i didn’t want him to try i said jim might wake up and come but tom wanted to resk it so we slid in there and got three candles and tom laid five cents on the table for pay then we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do tom but he must crawl to where jim was on his hands and knees and play something on him i waited and it seemed a good while everything was so still and lonesome as soon as tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fence and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house tom said he slipped jim’s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him and jim stirred a little but he didn’t wake afterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance and rode him all over the state and then set him under the trees again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it and next time jim told it he said they rode him down to new orleans and after that every time he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all over saddle boils jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers niggers would come miles to hear jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over same as if he was a wonder niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things jim would happen in and say “hm what you know ‘bout witches ” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat jim always kept that five center piece round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but he never told what it was he said to it niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything they had just for a sight of that five center piece but they wouldn’t touch it because the devil had had his hands on it jim was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches well when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and awful still and grand we went down the hill and found jo harper and ben rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the big scar on the hillside and went ashore we went to a clump of bushes and tom made everybody swear to keep the secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest part of the bushes then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands and knees we went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold and there we stopped tom says “now we’ll start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyer’s gang everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name in blood ” everybody was willing so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on and read it it swore every boy to stick to the band and never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band and nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use that mark and if he did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked tom if he got it out of his own head he said some of it but the rest was out of pirate books and robber books and every gang that was high toned had it some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told the secrets tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it in then ben rogers says “here’s huck finn he hain’t got no family what you going to do ‘bout him ” “well hain’t he got a father ” says tom sawyer “yes he’s got a father but you can’t never find him these days he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he hain’t been seen in these parts for a year or more ” they talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldn’t be fair and square for the others well nobody could think of anything to do everybody was stumped and set still i was most ready to cry but all at once i thought of a way and so i offered them miss watson they could kill her everybody said “oh she’ll do that’s all right huck can come in ” then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and i made my mark on the paper “now ” says ben rogers “what’s the line of business of this gang ” “nothing only robbery and murder ” tom said “but who are we going to rob houses or cattle or ” “stuff stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery it’s burglary ” says tom sawyer “we ain’t burglars that ain’t no sort of style we are highwaymen we stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on and kill the people and take their watches and money ” “must we always kill the people ” “oh certainly it’s best some authorities think different but mostly it’s considered best to kill them except some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till they’re ransomed ” “ransomed what’s that ” “i don’t know but that’s what they do i’ve seen it in books and so of course that’s what we’ve got to do ” “but how can we do it if we don’t know what it is ” “why blame it all we’ve _got_ to do it don’t i tell you it’s in the books do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books and get things all muddled up ” “oh that’s all very fine to _say_ tom sawyer but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it to them that’s the thing i want to get at now what do you reckon it is ” “well i don’t know but per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed it means that we keep them till they’re dead ” “now that’s something _like_ that’ll answer why couldn’t you said that before we’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death and a bothersome lot they’ll be too eating up everything and always trying to get loose ” “how you talk ben rogers how can they get loose when there’s a guard over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg ” “a guard well that _is_ good so somebody’s got to set up all night and never get any sleep just so as to watch them i think that’s foolishness why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here ” “because it ain’t in the books so that’s why now ben rogers do you want to do things regular or don’t you that’s the idea don’t you reckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct thing to do do you reckon _you_ can learn ‘em anything not by a good deal no sir we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way ” “all right i don’t mind but i say it’s a fool way anyhow say do we kill the women too ” “well ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you i wouldn’t let on kill the women no nobody ever saw anything in the books like that you fetch them to the cave and you’re always as polite as pie to them and by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more ” “well if that’s the way i’m agreed but i don’t take no stock in it mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows waiting to be ransomed that there won’t be no place for the robbers but go ahead i ain’t got nothing to say ” little tommy barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didn’t want to be a robber any more so they all made fun of him and called him cry baby and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets but tom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people ben rogers said he couldn’t get out much only sundays and so he wanted to begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday and that settled the thing they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started home i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i was dog tired'),\n",

       "  'life on the mississipi the river and its history the mississippi is well worth reading about it is not a commonplace river but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable considering the missouri its main branch it is the longest river in the world four thousand three hundred miles it seems safe to say that it is also the crookedest river in the world since in one part of its journey it uses up one thousand three hundred miles to cover the same ground that the crow would fly over in six hundred and seventy five it discharges three times as much water as the st lawrence twenty five times as much as the rhine and three hundred and thirty eight times as much as the thames no other river has so vast a drainage basin it draws its water supply from twenty eight states and territories from delaware on the atlantic seaboard and from all the country between that and idaho on the pacific slope a spread of forty five degrees of longitude the mississippi receives and carries to the gulf water from fifty four subordinate rivers that are navigable by steamboats and from some hundreds that are navigable by flats and keels the area of its drainage basin is as great as the combined areas of england wales scotland ireland france spain portugal germany austria italy and turkey and almost all this wide region is fertile the mississippi valley proper is exceptionally so it is a remarkable river in this that instead of widening toward its mouth it grows narrower grows narrower and deeper from the junction of the ohio to a point half way down to the sea the width averages a mile in high water thence to the sea the width steadily diminishes until at the ‘passes ’ above the mouth it is but little over half a mile at the junction of the ohio the mississippi’s depth is eighty seven feet the depth increases gradually reaching one hundred and twenty nine just above the mouth the difference in rise and fall is also remarkable not in the upper but in the lower river the rise is tolerably uniform down to natchez three hundred and sixty miles above the mouth about fifty feet but at bayou la fourche the river rises only twenty four feet at new orleans only fifteen and just above the mouth only two and one half an article in the new orleans ‘times democrat ’ based upon reports of able engineers states that the river annually empties four hundred and six million tons of mud into the gulf of mexico which brings to mind captain marryat’s rude name for the mississippi ‘the great sewer ’ this mud solidified would make a mass a mile square and two hundred and forty one feet high the mud deposit gradually extends the land but only gradually it has extended it not quite a third of a mile in the two hundred years which have elapsed since the river took its place in history the belief of the scientific people is that the mouth used to be at baton rouge where the hills cease and that the two hundred miles of land between there and the gulf was built by the river this gives us the age of that piece of country without any trouble at all one hundred and twenty thousand years yet it is much the youthfullest batch of country that lies around there anywhere the mississippi is remarkable in still another way its disposition to make prodigious jumps by cutting through narrow necks of land and thus straightening and shortening itself more than once it has shortened itself thirty miles at a single jump these cut offs have had curious effects they have thrown several river towns out into the rural districts and built up sand bars and forests in front of them the town of delta used to be three miles below vicksburg a recent cutoff has radically changed the position and delta is now _two miles above_ vicksburg both of these river towns have been retired to the country by that cut off a cut off plays havoc with boundary lines and jurisdictions for instance a man is living in the state of mississippi to day a cut off occurs to night and to morrow the man finds himself and his land over on the other side of the river within the boundaries and subject to the laws of the state of louisiana such a thing happening in the upper river in the old times could have transferred a slave from missouri to illinois and made a free man of him the mississippi does not alter its locality by cut offs alone it is always changing its habitat _bodily_ is always moving bodily _sidewise_ at hard times la the river is two miles west of the region it used to occupy as a result the original _site _of that settlement is not now in louisiana at all but on the other side of the river in the state of mississippi _nearly the whole of that one thousand three hundred miles of old mississippi river which la salle floated down in his canoes two hundred years ago is good solid dry ground now_ the river lies to the right of it in places and to the left of it in other places although the mississippi’s mud builds land but slowly down at the mouth where the gulfs billows interfere with its work it builds fast enough in better protected regions higher up for instance prophet’s island contained one thousand five hundred acres of land thirty years ago since then the river has added seven hundred acres to it but enough of these examples of the mighty stream’s eccentricities for the present i will give a few more of them further along in the book let us drop the mississippi’s physical history and say a word about its historical history so to speak we can glance briefly at its slumbrous first epoch in a couple of short s at its second and wider awake epoch in a couple more at its flushest and widest awake epoch in a good many succeeding s and then talk about its comparatively tranquil present epoch in what shall be left of the book the world and the books are so accustomed to use and over use the word ‘new’ in connection with our country that we early get and permanently retain the impression that there is nothing old about it we do of course know that there are several comparatively old dates in american history but the mere figures convey to our minds no just idea no distinct realization of the stretch of time which they represent to say that de soto the first white man who ever saw the mississippi river saw it in is a remark which states a fact without interpreting it it is something like giving the dimensions of a sunset by astronomical measurements and cataloguing the colors by their scientific names as a result you get the bald fact of the sunset but you don’t see the sunset it would have been better to paint a picture of it the date standing by itself means little or nothing to us but when one groups a few neighboring historical dates and facts around it he adds perspective and color and then realizes that this is one of the american dates which is quite respectable for age for instance when the mississippi was first seen by a white man less than a quarter of a century had elapsed since francis i ’s defeat at pavia the death of raphael the death of bayard _sans peur et sans reproche_ the driving out of the knights hospitallers from rhodes by the turks and the placarding of the ninety five propositions the act which began the reformation when de soto took his glimpse of the river ignatius loyola was an obscure name the order of the jesuits was not yet a year old michael angelo’s paint was not yet dry on the last judgment in the sistine chapel mary queen of scots was not yet born but would be before the year closed catherine de medici was a child elizabeth of england was not yet in her teens calvin benvenuto cellini and the emperor charles v were at the top of their fame and each was manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion margaret of navarre was writing the ‘heptameron’ and some religious books the first survives the others are forgotten wit and indelicacy being sometimes better literature preservers than holiness lax court morals and the absurd chivalry business were in full feather and the joust and the tournament were the frequent pastime of titled fine gentlemen who could fight better than they could spell while religion was the passion of their ladies and classifying their offspring into children of full rank and children by brevet their pastime in fact all around religion was in a peculiarly blooming condition the council of trent was being called the spanish inquisition was roasting and racking and burning with a free hand elsewhere on the continent the nations were being persuaded to holy living by the sword and fire in england henry viii had suppressed the monasteries burnt fisher and another bishop or two and was getting his english reformation and his harem effectively started when de soto stood on the banks of the mississippi it was still two years before luther’s death eleven years before the burning of servetus thirty years before the st bartholomew slaughter rabelais was not yet published ‘don quixote’ was not yet written shakespeare was not yet born a hundred long years must still elapse before englishmen would hear the name of oliver cromwell unquestionably the discovery of the mississippi is a datable fact which considerably mellows and modifies the shiny newness of our country and gives her a most respectable outside aspect of rustiness and antiquity de soto merely glimpsed the river then died and was buried in it by his priests and soldiers one would expect the priests and the soldiers to multiply the river’s dimensions by ten the spanish custom of the day and thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it on the contrary their narratives when they reached home did not excite that amount of curiosity the mississippi was left unvisited by whites during a term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days one may ‘sense’ the interval to his mind after a fashion by dividing it up in this way after de soto glimpsed the river a fraction short of a quarter of a century elapsed and then shakespeare was born lived a trifle more than half a century then died and when he had been in his grave considerably more than half a century the _second _white man saw the mississippi in our day we don’t allow a hundred and thirty years to elapse between glimpses of a marvel if somebody should discover a creek in the county next to the one that the north pole is in europe and america would start fifteen costly expeditions thither one to explore the creek and the other fourteen to hunt for each other for more than a hundred and fifty years there had been white settlements on our atlantic coasts these people were in intimate communication with the indians in the south the spaniards were robbing slaughtering enslaving and converting them higher up the english were trading beads and blankets to them for a consideration and throwing in civilization and whiskey ‘for lagniappe ’ and in canada the french were schooling them in a rudimentary way missionarying among them and drawing whole populations of them at a time to quebec and later to montreal to buy furs of them necessarily then these various clusters of whites must have heard of the great river of the far west and indeed they did hear of it vaguely so vaguely and indefinitely that its course proportions and locality were hardly even guessable the mere mysteriousness of the matter ought to have fired curiosity and compelled exploration but this did not occur apparently nobody happened to want such a river nobody needed it nobody was curious about it so for a century and a half the mississippi remained out of the market and undisturbed when de soto found it he was not hunting for a river and had no present occasion for one consequently he did not value it or even take any particular notice of it but at last la salle the frenchman conceived the idea of seeking out that river and exploring it it always happens that when a man seizes upon a neglected and important idea people inflamed with the same notion crop up all around it happened so in this instance naturally the question suggests itself why did these people want the river now when nobody had wanted it in the five preceding generations apparently it was because at this late day they thought they had discovered a way to make it useful for it had come to be believed that the mississippi emptied into the gulf of california and therefore afforded a short cut from canada to china previously the supposition had been that it emptied into the atlantic or sea of virginia the river and its explorers la salle himself sued for certain high privileges and they were graciously accorded him by louis xiv of inflated memory chief among them was the privilege to explore far and wide and build forts and stake out continents and hand the same over to the king and pay the expenses himself receiving in return some little advantages of one sort or another among them the monopoly of buffalo hides he spent several years and about all of his money in making perilous and painful trips between montreal and a fort which he had built on the illinois before he at last succeeded in getting his expedition in such a shape that he could strike for the mississippi and meantime other parties had had better fortune in joliet the merchant and marquette the priest crossed the country and reached the banks of the mississippi they went by way of the great lakes and from green bay in canoes by way of fox river and the wisconsin marquette had solemnly contracted on the feast of the immaculate conception that if the virgin would permit him to discover the great river he would name it conception in her honor he kept his word in that day all explorers traveled with an outfit of priests de soto had twenty four with him la salle had several also the expeditions were often out of meat and scant of clothes but they always had the furniture and other requisites for the mass they were always prepared as one of the quaint chroniclers of the time phrased it to ‘explain hell to the savages ’ on the th of june the canoes of joliet and marquette and their five subordinates reached the junction of the wisconsin with the mississippi mr parkman says ‘before them a wide and rapid current coursed athwart their way by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick in forests ’ he continues ‘turning southward they paddled down the stream through a solitude unrelieved by the faintest trace of man ’ a big cat fish collided with marquette’s canoe and startled him and reasonably enough for he had been warned by the indians that he was on a foolhardy journey and even a fatal one for the river contained a demon ‘whose roar could be heard at a great distance and who would engulf them in the abyss where he dwelt ’ i have seen a mississippi cat fish that was more than six feet long and weighed two hundred and fifty pounds and if marquette’s fish was the fellow to that one he had a fair right to think the river’s roaring demon was come ‘at length the buffalo began to appear grazing in herds on the great prairies which then bordered the river and marquette describes the fierce and stupid look of the old bulls as they stared at the intruders through the tangled mane which nearly blinded them ’ the voyagers moved cautiously ‘landed at night and made a fire to cook their evening meal then extinguished it embarked again paddled some way farther and anchored in the stream keeping a man on the watch till morning ’ they did this day after day and night after night and at the end of two weeks they had not seen a human being the river was an awful solitude then and it is now over most of its stretch but at the close of the fortnight they one day came upon the footprints of men in the mud of the western bank a robinson crusoe experience which carries an electric shiver with it yet when one stumbles on it in print they had been warned that the river indians were as ferocious and pitiless as the river demon and destroyed all comers without waiting for provocation but no matter joliet and marquette struck into the country to hunt up the proprietors of the tracks they found them by and by and were hospitably received and well treated if to be received by an indian chief who has taken off his last rag in order to appear at his level best is to be received hospitably and if to be treated abundantly to fish porridge and other game including dog and have these things forked into one’s mouth by the ungloved fingers of indians is to be well treated in the morning the chief and six hundred of his tribesmen escorted the frenchmen to the river and bade them a friendly farewell on the rocks above the present city of alton they found some rude and fantastic indian paintings which they describe a short distance below ‘a torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current of the mississippi boiling and surging and sweeping in its course logs branches and uprooted trees ’ this was the mouth of the missouri ‘that savage river ’ which ‘descending from its mad career through a vast unknown of barbarism poured its turbid floods into the bosom of its gentle sister ’ by and by they passed the mouth of the ohio they passed cane brakes they fought mosquitoes they floated along day after day through the deep silence and loneliness of the river drowsing in the scant shade of makeshift awnings and broiling with the heat they encountered and exchanged civilities with another party of indians and at last they reached the mouth of the arkansas about a month out from their starting point where a tribe of war whooping savages swarmed out to meet and murder them but they appealed to the virgin for help so in place of a fight there was a feast and plenty of pleasant palaver and fol de rol they had proved to their satisfaction that the mississippi did not empty into the gulf of california or into the atlantic they believed it emptied into the gulf of mexico they turned back now and carried their great news to canada but belief is not proof it was reserved for la salle to furnish the proof he was provokingly delayed by one misfortune after another but at last got his expedition under way at the end of the year in the dead of winter he and henri de tonty son of lorenzo tonty who invented the tontine his lieutenant started down the illinois with a following of eighteen indians brought from new england and twenty three frenchmen they moved in procession down the surface of the frozen river on foot and dragging their canoes after them on sledges at peoria lake they struck open water and paddled thence to the mississippi and turned their prows southward they plowed through the fields of floating ice past the mouth of the missouri past the mouth of the ohio by and by ‘and gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp landed on the th of february near the third chickasaw bluffs ’ where they halted and built fort prudhomme ‘again ’ says mr parkman ‘they embarked and with every stage of their adventurous progress the mystery of this vast new world was more and more unveiled more and more they entered the realms of spring the hazy sunlight the warm and drowsy air the tender foliage the opening flowers betokened the reviving life of nature ’ day by day they floated down the great bends in the shadow of the dense forests and in time arrived at the mouth of the arkansas first they were greeted by the natives of this locality as marquette had before been greeted by them with the booming of the war drum and the flourish of arms the virgin composed the difficulty in marquette’s case the pipe of peace did the same office for la salle the white man and the red man struck hands and entertained each other during three days then to the admiration of the savages la salle set up a cross with the arms of france on it and took possession of the whole country for the king the cool fashion of the time while the priest piously consecrated the robbery with a hymn the priest explained the mysteries of the faith ‘by signs ’ for the saving of the savages thus compensating them with possible possessions in heaven for the certain ones on earth which they had just been robbed of and also by signs la salle drew from these simple children of the forest acknowledgments of fealty to louis the putrid over the water nobody smiled at these colossal ironies these performances took place on the site of the future town of napoleon arkansas and there the first confiscation cross was raised on the banks of the great river marquette’s and joliet’s voyage of discovery ended at the same spot the site of the future town of napoleon when de soto took his fleeting glimpse of the river away back in the dim early days he took it from that same spot the site of the future town of napoleon arkansas therefore three out of the four memorable events connected with the discovery and exploration of the mighty river occurred by accident in one and the same place it is a most curious distinction when one comes to look at it and think about it france stole that vast country on that spot the future napoleon and by and by napoleon himself was to give the country back again make restitution not to the owners but to their white american heirs the voyagers journeyed on touching here and there ‘passed the sites since become historic of vicksburg and grand gulf ’ and visited an imposing indian monarch in the teche country whose capital city was a substantial one of sun baked bricks mixed with straw better houses than many that exist there now the chiefs house contained an audience room forty feet square and there he received tonty in state surrounded by sixty old men clothed in white cloaks there was a temple in the town with a mud wall about it ornamented with skulls of enemies sacrificed to the sun the voyagers visited the natchez indians near the site of the present city of that name where they found a ‘religious and political despotism a privileged class descended from the sun a temple and a sacred fire ’ it must have been like getting home again it was home with an advantage in fact for it lacked louis xiv a few more days swept swiftly by and la salle stood in the shadow of his confiscating cross at the meeting of the waters from delaware and from itaska and from the mountain ranges close upon the pacific with the waters of the gulf of mexico his task finished his prodigy achieved mr parkman in closing his fascinating narrative thus sums up ‘on that day the realm of france received on parchment a stupendous accession the fertile plains of texas the vast basin of the mississippi from its frozen northern springs to the sultry borders of the gulf from the woody ridges of the alleghanies to the bare peaks of the rocky mountains a region of savannas and forests sun cracked deserts and grassy prairies watered by a thousand rivers ranged by a thousand warlike tribes passed beneath the scepter of the sultan of versailles and all by virtue of a feeble human voice inaudible at half a mile ’'),\n",

       "  \"the american's claimant i it is a matchless morning in rural england on a fair hill we see a majestic pile the ivied walls and towers of cholmondeley castle huge relic and witness of the baronial grandeurs of the middle ages this is one of the seats of the earl of rossmore k g g c b k c m g etc etc etc etc etc who possesses twenty two thousand acres of english land owns a parish in london with two thousand houses on its lease roll and struggles comfortably along on an income of two hundred thousand pounds a year the father and founder of this proud old line was william the conqueror his very self the mother of it was not inventoried in history by name she being merely a random episode and inconsequential like the tanner’s daughter of falaise in a breakfast room of the castle on this breezy fine morning there are two persons and the cooling remains of a deserted meal one of these persons is the old lord tall erect square shouldered white haired stern browed a man who shows character in every feature attitude and movement and carries his seventy years as easily as most men carry fifty the other person is his only son and heir a dreamy eyed young fellow who looks about twenty six but is nearer thirty candor kindliness honesty sincerity simplicity modesty it is easy to see that these are cardinal traits of his character and so when you have clothed him in the formidable components of his name you somehow seem to be contemplating a lamb in armor his name and style being the honourable kirkcudbright llanover marjoribanks sellers viscount berkeley of cholmondeley castle warwickshire pronounced k’koobry thlanover marshbanks sellers vycount barkly of chumly castle warrikshr he is standing by a great window in an attitude suggestive of respectful attention to what his father is saying and equally respectful dissent from the positions and arguments offered the father walks the floor as he talks and his talk shows that his temper is away up toward summer heat “soft spirited as you are berkeley i am quite aware that when you have once made up your mind to do a thing which your ideas of honor and justice require you to do argument and reason are for the time being wasted upon you yes and ridicule persuasion supplication and command as well to my mind ” “father if you will look at it without prejudice without passion you must concede that i am not doing a rash thing a thoughtless wilful thing with nothing substantial behind it to justify it i did not create the american claimant to the earldom of rossmore i did not hunt for him did not find him did not obtrude him upon your notice he found himself he injected himself into our lives ” “and has made mine a purgatory for ten years with his tiresome letters his wordy reasonings his acres of tedious evidence ” “which you would never read would never consent to read yet in common fairness he was entitled to a hearing that hearing would either prove he was the rightful earl in which case our course would be plain or it would prove that he wasn’t in which case our course would be equally plain i have read his evidences my lord i have conned them well studied them patiently and thoroughly the chain seems to be complete no important link wanting i believe he is the rightful earl ” “and i a usurper a nameless pauper a tramp consider what you are saying sir ” “father if he is the rightful earl would you could you that fact being established consent to keep his titles and his properties from him a day an hour a minute ” “you are talking nonsense nonsense lurid idiocy now listen to me i will make a confession if you wish to call it by that name i did not read those evidences because i had no occasion to i was made familiar with them in the time of this claimant’s father and of my own father forty years ago this fellow’s predecessors have kept mine more or less familiar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty years the truth is the rightful heir did go to america with the fairfax heir or about the same time but disappeared somewhere in the wilds of virginia got married and began to breed savages for the claimant market wrote no letters home was supposed to be dead his younger brother softly took possession presently the american did die and straightway his eldest product put in his claim by letter letter still in existence and died before the uncle in possession found time or maybe inclination to answer the infant son of that eldest product grew up long interval you see and he took to writing letters and furnishing evidences well successor after successor has done the same down to the present idiot it was a succession of paupers not one of them was ever able to pay his passage to england or institute suit the fairfaxes kept their lordship alive and so they have never lost it to this day although they live in maryland their friend lost his by his own neglect you perceive now that the facts in this case bring us to precisely this result morally the american tramp is rightful earl of rossmore legally he has no more right than his dog there now are you satisfied ” there was a pause then the son glanced at the crest carved in the great oaken mantel and said with a regretful note in his voice “since the introduction of heraldic symbols the motto of this house has been ‘suum cuique’ to every man his own by your own intrepidly frank confession my lord it is become a sarcasm if simon lathers ” “keep that exasperating name to yourself for ten years it has pestered my eye and tortured my ear till at last my very footfalls time themselves to the brain racking rhythm of simon lathers simon lathers simon lathers and now to make its presence in my soul eternal immortal imperishable you have resolved to to what is it you have resolved to do ” “to go to simon lathers in america and change places with him ” “what deliver the reversion of the earldom into his hands ” “that is my purpose ” “make this tremendous surrender without even trying the fantastic case in the lords ” “ye s ” with hesitation and some embarrassment “by all that is amazing i believe you are insane my son see here have you been training with that ass again that radical if you prefer the term though the words are synonymous lord tanzy of tollmache ” the son did not reply and the old lord continued “yes you confess that puppy that shame to his birth and caste who holds all hereditary lordships and privilege to be usurpation all nobility a tinsel sham all aristocratic institutions a fraud all inequalities in rank a legalized crime and an infamy and no bread honest bread that a man doesn’t earn by his own work work pah ” and the old patrician brushed imaginary labor dirt from his white hands “you have come to hold just those opinions yourself i suppose ” he added with a sneer a faint flush in the younger man’s cheek told that the shot had hit and hurt but he answered with dignity “i have i say it without shame i feel none and now my reason for resolving to renounce my heirship without resistance is explained i wish to retire from what to me is a false existence a false position and begin my life over again begin it right begin it on the level of mere manhood unassisted by factitious aids and succeed or fail by pure merit or the want of it i will go to america where all men are equal and all have an equal chance i will live or die sink or swim win or lose as just a man that alone and not a single helping gaud or fiction back of it ” “hear hear ” the two men looked each other steadily in the eye a moment or two then the elder one added musingly “ab so lutely cra zy ab solutely ” after another silence he said as one who long troubled by clouds detects a ray of sunshine “well there will be one satisfaction simon lathers will come here to enter into his own and i will drown him in the horsepond the poor devil always so humble in his letters so pitiful so deferential so steeped in reverence for our great line and lofty station so anxious to placate us so prayerful for recognition as a relative a bearer in his veins of our sacred blood and withal so poor so needy so threadbare and pauper shod as to raiment so despised so laughed at for his silly claimantship by the lewd american scum around him ah the vulgar crawling insufferable tramp to read one of his cringing nauseating letters well ” this to a splendid flunkey all in inflamed plush and buttons and knee breeches as to his trunk and a glinting white frost work of ground glass paste as to his head who stood with his heels together and the upper half of him bent forward a salver in his hands “the letters my lord ” my lord took them and the servant disappeared “among the rest an american letter from the tramp of course jove but here’s a change no brown paper envelope this time filched from a shop and carrying the shop’s advertisement in the corner oh no a proper enough envelope with a most ostentatiously broad mourning border for his cat perhaps since he was a bachelor and fastened with red wax a batch of it as big as a half crown and and our crest for a seal motto and all and the ignorant sprawling hand is gone he sports a secretary evidently a secretary with a most confident swing and flourish to his pen oh indeed our fortunes are improving over there our meek tramp has undergone a metamorphosis ” “read it my lord please ” “yes this time i will for the sake of the cat ” sixteenth street washington may my lord it is my painful duty to announce to you that the head of our illustrious house is no more the right honourable the most noble the most puissant simon lathers lord rossmore having departed this life “gone at last this is unspeakably precious news my son ” at his seat in the environs of the hamlet of duffy’s corners in the grand old state of arkansas and his twin brother with him both being crushed by a log at a smoke house raising owing to carelessness on the part of all present referable to over confidence and gaiety induced by overplus of sour mash “extolled be sour mash whatever that may be eh berkeley ” five days ago with no scion of our ancient race present to close his eyes and inter him with the honors due his historic name and lofty rank in fact he is on the ice yet him and his brother friends took up a collection for it but i shall take immediate occasion to have their noble remains shipped to you “great heavens ” for interment with due ceremonies and solemnities in the family vault or mausoleum of our house meantime i shall put up a pair of hatchments on my house front and you will of course do the same at your several seats i have also to remind you that by this sad disaster i as sole heir inherit and become seized of all the titles honors lands and goods of our lamented relative and must of necessity painful as the duty is shortly require at the bar of the lords restitution of these dignities and properties now illegally enjoyed by your titular lordship with assurance of my distinguished consideration and warm cousinly regard i remain your titular lordship’s most obedient servant mulberry sellers earl rossmore “immense come this one’s interesting why berkeley his breezy impudence is is why it’s colossal it’s sublime ” “no this one doesn’t seem to cringe much ” “cringe why he doesn’t know the meaning of the word hatchments to commemorate that sniveling tramp and his fraternal duplicate and he is going to send me the remains the late claimant was a fool but plainly this new one’s a maniac what a name mulberry sellers there’s music for you simon lathers mulberry sellers mulberry sellers simon lathers sounds like machinery working and churning simon lathers mulberry sel are you going ” “if i have your leave father ” the old gentleman stood musing some time after his son was gone this was his thought “he is a good boy and lovable let him take his own course as it would profit nothing to oppose him make things worse in fact my arguments and his aunt’s persuasions have failed let us see what america can do for us let us see what equality and hard times can effect for the mental health of a brain sick young british lord going to renounce his lordship and be a man yas ” ii colonel mulberry sellers this was some days before he wrote his letter to lord rossmore was seated in his “library ” which was also his “drawing room” and was also his “picture gallery” and likewise his “work shop ” sometimes he called it by one of these names sometimes by another according to occasion and circumstance he was constructing what seemed to be some kind of a frail mechanical toy and was apparently very much interested in his work he was a white headed man now but otherwise he was as young alert buoyant visionary and enterprising as ever his loving old wife sat near by contentedly knitting and thinking with a cat asleep in her lap the room was large light and had a comfortable look in fact a home like look though the furniture was of a humble sort and not over abundant and the knickknacks and things that go to adorn a living room not plenty and not costly but there were natural flowers and there was an abstract and unclassifiable something about the place which betrayed the presence in the house of somebody with a happy taste and an effective touch even the deadly chromos on the walls were somehow without offence in fact they seemed to belong there and to add an attraction to the room a fascination anyway for whoever got his eye on one of them was like to gaze and suffer till he died you have seen that kind of pictures some of these terrors were landscapes some libeled the sea some were ostensible portraits all were crimes all the portraits were recognizable as dead americans of distinction and yet through labeling added by a daring hand they were all doing duty here as “earls of rossmore ” the newest one had left the works as andrew jackson but was doing its best now as “simon lathers lord rossmore present earl ” on one wall was a cheap old railroad map of warwickshire this had been newly labeled “the rossmore estates ” on the opposite wall was another map and this was the most imposing decoration of the establishment and the first to catch a stranger’s attention because of its great size it had once borne simply the title siberia but now the word “future” had been written in front of that word there were other additions in red ink many cities with great populations set down scattered over the vast country at points where neither cities nor populations exist to day one of these cities with population placed at bore the name “libertyorloffskoizalinski ” and there was a still more populous one centrally located and marked “capital ” which bore the name “freedomolovnaivanovich ” the “mansion” the colonel’s usual name for the house was a rickety old two story frame of considerable size which had been painted some time or other but had nearly forgotten it it was away out in the ragged edge of washington and had once been somebody’s country place it had a neglected yard around it with paling fence that needed straightening up in places and a gate that would stay shut by the door post were several modest tin signs “col mulberry sellers attorney at law and claim agent ” was the principal one one learned from the others that the colonel was a materializer a hypnotizer a mind cure dabbler and so on for he was a man who could always find things to do a white headed negro man with spectacles and damaged white cotton gloves appeared in the presence made a stately obeisance and announced “marse washington hawkins suh ” “great scott show him in dan’l show him in ” the colonel and his wife were on their feet in a moment and the next moment were joyfully wringing the hands of a stoutish discouraged looking man whose general aspect suggested that he was fifty years old but whose hair swore to a hundred “well well well washington my boy it is good to look at you again sit down sit down and make yourself at home there now why you look perfectly natural aging a little just a little but you’d have known him anywhere wouldn’t you polly ” “oh yes berry he’s just like his pa would have looked if he’d lived dear dear where have you dropped from let me see how long is it since ” “i should say it’s all of fifteen years mrs sellers ” “well well how time does get away with us yes and oh the changes that ” there was a sudden catch of her voice and a trembling of the lip the men waiting reverently for her to get command of herself and go on but after a little struggle she turned away with her apron to her eyes and softly disappeared “seeing you made her think of the children poor thing dear dear they’re all dead but the youngest “but banish care it’s no time for it now on with the dance let joy be unconfined is my motto whether there’s any dance to dance or any joy to unconfine you’ll be the healthier for it every time every time washington it’s my experience and i’ve seen a good deal of this world come where have you disappeared to all these years and are you from there now or where are you from ” “i don’t quite think you would ever guess colonel cherokee strip ” “my land ” “sure as you live ” “you can’t mean it actually living out there ” “well yes if a body may call it that though it’s a pretty strong term for ‘dobies and jackass rabbits boiled beans and slap jacks depression withered hopes poverty in all its varieties ” “louise out there ” “yes and the children ” “out there now ” “yes i couldn’t afford to bring them with me ” “oh i see you had to come claim against the government make yourself perfectly easy i’ll take care of that ” “but it isn’t a claim against the government ” “no want to be postmaster that’s all right leave it to me i’ll fix it ” “but it isn’t postmaster you’re all astray yet ” “well good gracious washington why don’t you come out and tell me what it is what do you want to be so reserved and distrustful with an old friend like me for don’t you reckon i can keep a se ” “there’s no secret about it you merely don’t give me a chance to ” “now look here old friend i know the human race and i know that when a man comes to washington i don’t care if it’s from heaven let alone cherokee strip it’s because he wants something and i know that as a rule he’s not going to get it that he’ll stay and try for another thing and won’t get that the same luck with the next and the next and the next and keeps on till he strikes bottom and is too poor and ashamed to go back even to cherokee strip and at last his heart breaks and they take up a collection and bury him there don’t interrupt me i know what i’m talking about happy and prosperous in the far west wasn’t i you know that principal citizen of hawkeye looked up to by everybody kind of an autocrat actually a kind of an autocrat washington well nothing would do but i must go minister to st james the governor and everybody insisting you know and so at last i consented no getting out of it had to do it so here i came a day too late washington think of that what little things change the world’s history yes sir the place had been filled well there i was you see i offered to compromise and go to paris the president was very sorry and all that but that place you see didn’t belong to the west so there i was again there was no help for it so i had to stoop a little we all reach the day some time or other when we’ve got to do that washington and it’s not a bad thing for us either take it by and large and all around i had to stoop a little and offer to take constantinople washington consider this for it’s perfectly true within a month i asked for china within another month i begged for japan one year later i was away down down down supplicating with tears and anguish for the bottom office in the gift of the government of the united states flint picker in the cellars of the war department and by george i didn’t get it ” “flint picker ” “yes office established in the time of the revolution last century the musket flints for the military posts were supplied from the capitol they do it yet for although the flint arm has gone out and the forts have tumbled down the decree hasn’t been repealed been overlooked and forgotten you see and so the vacancies where old ticonderoga and others used to stand still get their six quarts of gun flints a year just the same ” washington said musingly after a pause “how strange it seems to start for minister to england at twenty thousand a year and fail for flintpicker at ” “three dollars a week it’s human life washington just an epitome of human ambition and struggle and the outcome you aim for the palace and get drowned in the sewer ” there was another meditative silence then washington said with earnest compassion in his voice “and so after coming here against your inclination to satisfy your sense of patriotic duty and appease a selfish public clamor you get absolutely nothing for it ” “nothing ” the colonel had to get up and stand to get room for his amazement to expand “nothing washington i ask you this to be a perpetual member and the only perpetual member of a diplomatic body accredited to the greatest country on earth do you call that nothing ” it was washington’s turn to be amazed he was stricken dumb but the wide eyed wonder the reverent admiration expressed in his face were more eloquent than any words could have been the colonel’s wounded spirit was healed and he resumed his seat pleased and content he leaned forward and said impressively “what was due to a man who had become forever conspicuous by an experience without precedent in the history of the world a man made permanently and diplomatically sacred so to speak by having been connected temporarily through solicitation with every single diplomatic post in the roster of this government from envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the court of st james all the way down to consul to a guano rock in the strait of sunda salary payable in guano which disappeared by volcanic convulsion the day before they got down to my name in the list of applicants certainly something august enough to be answerable to the size of this unique and memorable experience was my due and i got it by the common voice of this community by acclamation of the people that mighty utterance which brushes aside laws and legislation and from whose decrees there is no appeal i was named perpetual member of the diplomatic body representing the multifarious sovereignties and civilizations of the globe near the republican court of the united states of america and they brought me home with a torchlight procession ” “it is wonderful colonel simply wonderful ” “it’s the loftiest official position in the whole earth ” “i should think so and the most commanding ” “you have named the word think of it i frown and there is war i smile and contending nations lay down their arms ” “it is awful the responsibility i mean ” “it is nothing responsibility is no burden to me i am used to it have always been used to it ” “and the work the work do you have to attend all the sittings ” “who i does the emperor of russia attend the conclaves of the governors of the provinces he sits at home and indicates his pleasure ” washington was silent a moment then a deep sigh escaped him “how proud i was an hour ago how paltry seems my little promotion now colonel the reason i came to washington is i am congressional delegate from cherokee strip ” the colonel sprang to his feet and broke out with prodigious enthusiasm “give me your hand my boy this is immense news i congratulate you with all my heart my prophecies stand confirmed i always said it was in you i always said you were born for high distinction and would achieve it you ask polly if i didn’t ” washington was dazed by this most unexpected demonstration “why colonel there’s nothing to it that little narrow desolate unpeopled oblong streak of grass and gravel lost in the remote wastes of the vast continent why it’s like representing a billiard table a discarded one ” “tut tut it’s a great it’s a staving preferment and just opulent with influence here ” “shucks colonel i haven’t even a vote ” “that’s nothing you can make speeches ” “no i can’t the population’s only two hundred ” “that’s all right that’s all right ” “and they hadn’t any right to elect me we’re not even a territory there’s no organic act the government hasn’t any official knowledge of us whatever ” “never mind about that i’ll fix that i’ll rush the thing through i’ll get you organized in no time ” “will you colonel it’s too good of you but it’s just your old sterling self the same old ever faithful friend ” and the grateful tears welled up in washington’s eyes “it’s just as good as done my boy just as good as done shake hands we’ll hitch teams together you and i and we’ll make things hum ”\"),\n",

       "  'the gilded age and charles dudley warner i june squire hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks called the “stile ” in front of his house contemplating the morning the locality was obedstown east tennessee you would not know that obedstown stood on the top of a mountain for there was nothing about the landscape to indicate it but it did a mountain that stretched abroad over whole counties and rose very gradually the district was called the “knobs of east tennessee ” and had a reputation like nazareth as far as turning out any good thing was concerned the squire’s house was a double log cabin in a state of decay two or three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold and lifted their heads sadly whenever mrs hawkins or the children stepped in and out over their bodies rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard a bench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of water and a gourd a cat had begun to drink from the pail but the exertion was overtaxing her energies and she had stopped to rest there was an ash hopper by the fence and an iron pot for soft soap boiling near it this dwelling constituted one fifteenth of obedstown the other fourteen houses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the corn fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the city and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on his eyes for information “squire” hawkins got his title from being postmaster of obedstown not that the title properly belonged to the office but because in those regions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort and so the usual courtesy had been extended to hawkins the mail was monthly and sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single delivery even a rush like this did not fill up the postmaster’s whole month though and therefore he “kept store” in the intervals the squire was contemplating the morning it was balmy and tranquil the vagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers the murmur of bees was in the air there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that summer woodlands bring to the senses and the vague pleasurable melancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire presently the united states mail arrived on horseback there was but one letter and it was for the postmaster the long legged youth who carried the mail tarried an hour to talk for there was no hurry and in a little while the male population of the village had assembled to help as a general thing they were dressed in homespun “jeans ” blue or yellow here were no other varieties of it all wore one suspender and sometimes two yarn ones knitted at home some wore vests but few wore coats such coats and vests as did appear however were rather picturesque than otherwise for they were made of tolerably fanciful patterns of calico a fashion which prevails thereto this day among those of the community who have tastes above the common level and are able to afford style every individual arrived with his hands in his pockets a hand came out occasionally for a purpose but it always went back again after service and if it was the head that was served just the cant that the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted under was retained until the next call altered the inclination many hats were present but none were erect and no two were canted just alike we are speaking impartially of men youths and boys and we are also speaking of these three estates when we say that every individual was either chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises or smoking the same in a corn cob pipe few of the men wore whiskers none wore moustaches some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and hiding the throat the only pattern recognized there as being the correct thing in whiskers but no part of any individual’s face had seen a razor for a week these neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier reflectively while he talked but fatigue soon began to show itself and one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the fence hump shouldered and grave like a company of buzzards assembled for supper and listening for the death rattle old damrell said “tha hain’t no news ‘bout the jedge hit ain’t likely ” “cain’t tell for sartin some thinks he’s gwyne to be ‘long toreckly and some thinks ‘e hain’t russ mosely he tote ole hanks he mought git to obeds tomorrer or nex’ day he reckoned ” “well i wisht i knowed i got a ‘prime sow and pigs in the cote house and i hain’t got no place for to put ‘em if the jedge is a gwyne to hold cote i got to roust ‘em out i reckon but tomorrer’ll do i ‘spect ” the speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stem end of a tomato and shot a bumble bee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet away one after another the several chewers expressed a charge of tobacco juice and delivered it at the deceased with steady aim and faultless accuracy “what’s a stirrin’ down ‘bout the forks ” continued old damrell “well i dunno skasely ole drake higgins he’s ben down to shelby las’ week tuck his crap down couldn’t git shet o’ the most uv it hit wasn’t no time for to sell he say so he ‘fotch it back agin ‘lowin’ to wait tell fall talks ‘bout goin’ to mozouri lots uv ‘ems talkin’ that away down thar ole higgins say cain’t make a livin’ here no mo’ sich times as these si higgins he’s ben over to kaintuck n’ married a high toned gal thar outen the fust families an’ he’s come back to the forks with jist a hell’s mint o’ whoop jamboree notions folks says he’s tuck an’ fixed up the ole house like they does in kaintuck he say an’ tha’s ben folks come cler from turpentine for to see it he’s tuck an gawmed it all over on the inside with plarsterin’ ” “what’s plasterin’ ” “i dono hit’s what he calls it ole mam higgins she tole me she say she wasn’t gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog says it’s mud or some sich kind o’ nastiness that sticks on n’ covers up everything plarsterin’ si calls it ” this marvel was discussed at considerable length and almost with animation but presently there was a dog fight over in the neighborhood of the blacksmith shop and the visitors slid off their perch like so many turtles and strode to the battle field with an interest bordering on eagerness the squire remained and read his letter then he sighed and sat long in meditation at intervals he said “missouri missouri well well well everything is so uncertain ” at last he said “i believe i’ll do it a man will just rot here my house my yard everything around me in fact shows’ that i am becoming one of these cattle and i used to be thrifty in other times ” he was not more than thirty five but he had a worn look that made him seem older he left the stile entered that part of his house which was the store traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of beeswax to an old dame in linsey woolsey put his letter away and went into the kitchen his wife was there constructing some dried apple pies a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weather vane of his own contriving his small sister close upon four years of age was sopping corn bread in some gravy left in the bottom of a frying pan and trying hard not to sop over a finger mark that divided the pan through the middle for the other side belonged to the brother whose musings made him forget his stomach for the moment a negro woman was busy cooking at a vast fire place shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the place “nancy i’ve made up my mind the world is done with me and perhaps i ought to be done with it but no matter i can wait i am going to missouri i won’t stay in this dead country and decay with it i’ve had it on my mind sometime i’m going to sell out here for whatever i can get and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and start ” “anywhere that suits you suits me si and the children can’t be any worse off in missouri than they are here i reckon ” motioning his wife to a private conference in their own room hawkins said “no they’ll be better off i’ve looked out for them nancy ” and his face lighted “do you see these papers well they are evidence that i have taken up seventy five thousand acres of land in this county think what an enormous fortune it will be some day why nancy enormous don’t express it the word’s too tame i tell your nancy ” “for goodness sake si ” “wait nancy wait let me finish i’ve been secretly bailing and fuming with this grand inspiration for weeks and i must talk or i’ll burst i haven’t whispered to a soul not a word have had my countenance under lock and key for fear it might drop something that would tell even these animals here how to discern the gold mine that’s glaring under their noses now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it in the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly five or ten dollars the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an acre now but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars fifty dollars a hundred dollars an acre what should you say to” here he dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see that there were no eavesdroppers “a thousand dollars an acre “well you may open your eyes and stare but it’s so you and i may not see the day but they’ll see it mind i tell you they’ll see it nancy you’ve heard of steamboats and maybe you believed in them of course you did you’ve heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies and humbugs but they’re not lies and humbugs they’re a reality and they’re going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now they’re going to make a revolution in this world’s affairs that will make men dizzy to contemplate i’ve been watching i’ve been watching while some people slept and i know what’s coming “even you and i will see the day that steamboats will come up that little turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours and in high water they’ll come right to it and this is not all nancy it isn’t even half there’s a bigger wonder the railroad these worms here have never even heard of it and when they do they’ll not believe in it but it’s another fact coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an hour heavens and earth think of that nancy twenty miles an hour it makes a man’s brain whirl some day when you and i are in our graves there’ll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles all the way down from the cities of the northern states to new orleans and its got to run within thirty miles of this land may be even touch a corner of it well do you know they’ve quit burning wood in some places in the eastern states and what do you suppose they burn coal ” he bent over and whispered again “there’s world worlds of it on this land you know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch well that’s it you’ve taken it for rocks so has every body here and they’ve built little dams and such things with it one man was going to build a chimney out of it nancy i expect i turned as white as a sheet why it might have caught fire and told everything i showed him it was too crumbly then he was going to build it of copper ore splendid yellow forty per cent ore there’s fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore on our land it scared me to death the idea of this fool starting a smelting furnace in his house without knowing it and getting his dull eyes opened and then he was going to build it of iron ore there’s mountains of iron ore here nancy whole mountains of it i wouldn’t take any chances i just stuck by him i haunted him i never let him alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the chimneys in this dismal country pine forests wheat land corn land iron copper coal wait till the railroads come and the steamboats we’ll never see the day nancy never in the world never never never child we’ve got to drag along drag along and eat crusts in toil and poverty all hopeless and forlorn but they’ll ride in coaches nancy they’ll live like the princes of the earth they’ll be courted and worshiped their names will be known from ocean to ocean ah well a day will they ever come back here on the railroad and the steamboat and say ‘this one little spot shall not be touched this hovel shall be sacred for here our father and our mother suffered for us thought for us laid the foundations of our future as solid as the hills ’” “you are a great good noble soul si hawkins and i am an honored woman to be the wife of such a man” and the tears stood in her eyes when she said it “we will go to missouri you are out of your place here among these groping dumb creatures we will find a higher place where you can walk with your own kind and be understood when you speak not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue i would go anywhere anywhere in the wide world with you i would rather my body would starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in this lonely land ” “spoken like yourself my child but we’ll not starve nancy far from it i have a letter from beriah sellers just came this day a letter that i’ll read you a line from it ” he flew out of the room a shadow blurred the sunlight in nancy’s face there was uneasiness in it and disappointment a procession of disturbing thoughts began to troop through her mind saying nothing aloud she sat with her hands in her lap now and then she clasped them then unclasped them then tapped the ends of the fingers together sighed nodded smiled occasionally paused shook her head this pantomime was the elocutionary expression of an unspoken soliloquy which had something of this shape “i was afraid of it was afraid of it trying to make our fortune in virginia beriah sellers nearly ruined us and we had to settle in kentucky and start over again trying to make our fortune in kentucky he crippled us again and we had to move here trying to make our fortune here he brought us clear down to the ground nearly he’s an honest soul and means the very best in the world but i’m afraid i’m afraid he’s too flighty he has splendid ideas and he’ll divide his chances with his friends with a free hand the good generous soul but something does seem to always interfere and spoil everything i never did think he was right well balanced but i don’t blame my husband for i do think that when that man gets his head full of a new notion he can out talk a machine he’ll make anybody believe in that notion that’ll listen to him ten minutes why i do believe he would make a deaf and dumb man believe in it and get beside himself if you only set him where he could see his eyes tally and watch his hands explain what a head he has got when he got up that idea there in virginia of buying up whole loads of negroes in delaware and virginia and tennessee very quiet having papers drawn to have them delivered at a place in alabama and take them and pay for them away yonder at a certain time and then in the meantime get a law made stopping everybody from selling negroes to the south after a certain day it was somehow that way mercy how the man would have made money negroes would have gone up to four prices but after he’d spent money and worked hard and traveled hard and had heaps of negroes all contracted for and everything going along just right he couldn’t get the laws passed and down the whole thing tumbled and there in kentucky when he raked up that old numskull that had been inventing away at a perpetual motion machine for twenty two years and beriah sellers saw at a glance where just one more little cog wheel would settle the business why i could see it as plain as day when he came in wild at midnight and hammered us out of bed and told the whole thing in a whisper with the doors bolted and the candle in an empty barrel oceans of money in it anybody could see that but it did cost a deal to buy the old numskull out and then when they put the new cog wheel in they’d overlooked something somewhere and it wasn’t any use the troublesome thing wouldn’t go that notion he got up here did look as handy as anything in the world and how him and si did sit up nights working at it with the curtains down and me watching to see if any neighbors were about the man did honestly believe there was a fortune in that black gummy oil that stews out of the bank si says is coal and he refined it himself till it was like water nearly and it did burn there’s no two ways about that and i reckon he’d have been all right in cincinnati with his lamp that he got made that time he got a house full of rich speculators to see him exhibit only in the middle of his speech it let go and almost blew the heads off the whole crowd i haven’t got over grieving for the money that cost yet i am sorry enough beriah sellers is in missouri now but i was glad when he went i wonder what his letter says but of course it’s cheerful he’s never down hearted never had any trouble in his life didn’t know it if he had it’s always sunrise with that man and fine and blazing at that never gets noon though leaves off and rises again nobody can help liking the creature he means so well but i do dread to come across him again he’s bound to set us all crazy of course well there goes old widow hopkins it always takes her a week to buy a spool of thread and trade a hank of yarn maybe si can come with the letter now ” and he did “widow hopkins kept me i haven’t any patience with such tedious people now listen nancy just listen at this “‘come right along to missouri don’t wait and worry about a good price but sell out for whatever you can get and come along or you might be too late throw away your traps if necessary and come empty handed you’ll never regret it it’s the grandest country the loveliest land the purest atmosphere i can’t describe it no pen can do it justice and it’s filling up every day people coming from everywhere i’ve got the biggest scheme on earth and i’ll take you in i’ll take in every friend i’ve got that’s ever stood by me for there’s enough for all and to spare mum’s the word don’t whisper keep yourself to yourself you’ll see come rush hurry don’t wait for anything ’ “it’s the same old boy nancy jest the same old boy ain’t he ” “yes i think there’s a little of the old sound about his voice yet i suppose you you’ll still go si ” “go well i should think so nancy it’s all a chance of course and chances haven’t been kind to us i’ll admit but whatever comes old wife they’re provided for thank god for that ” “amen ” came low and earnestly and with an activity and a suddenness that bewildered obedstown and almost took its breath away the hawkinses hurried through with their arrangements in four short months and flitted out into the great mysterious blank that lay beyond the knobs of tennessee ii toward the close of the third day’s journey the wayfarers were just beginning to think of camping when they came upon a log cabin in the woods hawkins drew rein and entered the yard a boy about ten years old was sitting in the cabin door with his face bowed in his hands hawkins approached expecting his footfall to attract attention but it did not he halted a moment and then said “come come little chap you mustn’t be going to sleep before sundown” with a tired expression the small face came up out of the hands a face down which tears were flowing “ah i’m sorry i spoke so my boy tell me is anything the matter ” the boy signified with a scarcely perceptible gesture that the trouble was in the house and made room for hawkins to pass then he put his face in his hands again and rocked himself about as one suffering a grief that is too deep to find help in moan or groan or outcry hawkins stepped within it was a poverty stricken place six or eight middle aged country people of both sexes were grouped about an object in the middle of the room they were noiselessly busy and they talked in whispers when they spoke hawkins uncovered and approached a coffin stood upon two backless chairs these neighbors had just finished disposing the body of a woman in it a woman with a careworn gentle face that had more the look of sleep about it than of death an old lady motioned toward the door and said to hawkins in a whisper “his mother po’ thing died of the fever last night tha warn’t no sich thing as saving of her but it’s better for her better for her husband and the other two children died in the spring and she hain’t ever hilt up her head sence she jest went around broken hearted like and never took no intrust in anything but clay that’s the boy thar she jest worshiped clay and clay he worshiped her they didn’t ‘pear to live at all only when they was together looking at each other loving one another she’s ben sick three weeks and if you believe me that child has worked and kep’ the run of the med’cin and the times of giving it and sot up nights and nussed her and tried to keep up her sperits the same as a grown up person and last night when she kep’ a sinking and sinking and turned away her head and didn’t know him no mo’ it was fitten to make a body’s heart break to see him climb onto the bed and lay his cheek agin hern and call her so pitiful and she not answer but bymeby she roused up like and looked around wild and then she see him and she made a great cry and snatched him to her breast and hilt him close and kissed him over and over agin but it took the last po’ strength she had and so her eyelids begin to close down and her arms sort o’ drooped away and then we see she was gone po’ creetur and clay he oh the po’ motherless thing i cain’t talk about it i cain’t bear to talk about it ” clay had disappeared from the door but he came in now and the neighbors reverently fell apart and made way for him he leaned upon the open coffin and let his tears course silently then he put out his small hand and smoothed the hair and stroked the dead face lovingly after a bit he brought his other hand up from behind him and laid three or four fresh wild flowers upon the breast bent over and kissed the unresponsive lips time and time again and then turned away and went out of the house without looking at any of the company the old lady said to hawkins “she always loved that kind o’ flowers he fetched ‘em for her every morning and she always kissed him they was from away north somers she kep’ school when she fust come goodness knows what’s to become o’ that po’ boy no father no mother no kin folks of no kind nobody to go to nobody that k’yers for him and all of us is so put to it for to get along and families so large ” hawkins understood all eyes were turned inquiringly upon him he said “friends i am not very well provided for myself but still i would not turn my back on a homeless orphan if he will go with me i will give him a home and loving regard i will do for him as i would have another do for a child of my own in misfortune ” one after another the people stepped forward and wrung the stranger’s hand with cordial good will and their eyes looked all that their hands could not express or their lips speak “said like a true man ” said one “you was a stranger to me a minute ago but you ain’t now ” said another “it’s bread cast upon the waters it’ll return after many days ” said the old lady whom we have heard speak before “you got to camp in my house as long as you hang out here ” said one “if tha hain’t room for you and yourn my tribe’ll turn out and camp in the hay loft ” a few minutes afterward while the preparations for the funeral were being concluded mr hawkins arrived at his wagon leading his little waif by the hand and told his wife all that had happened and asked her if he had done right in giving to her and to himself this new care she said “if you’ve done wrong si hawkins it’s a wrong that will shine brighter at the judgment day than the rights that many a man has done before you and there isn’t any compliment you can pay me equal to doing a thing like this and finishing it up just taking it for granted that i’ll be willing to it willing come to me you poor motherless boy and let me take your grief and help you carry it ” when the child awoke in the morning it was as if from a troubled dream but slowly the confusion in his mind took form and he remembered his great loss the beloved form in the coffin his talk with a generous stranger who offered him a home the funeral where the stranger’s wife held him by the hand at the grave and cried with him and comforted him and he remembered how this new mother tucked him in his bed in the neighboring farm house and coaxed him to talk about his troubles and then heard him say his prayers and kissed him good night and left him with the soreness in his heart almost healed and his bruised spirit at rest and now the new mother came again and helped him to dress and combed his hair and drew his mind away by degrees from the dismal yesterday by telling him about the wonderful journey he was going to take and the strange things he was going to see and after breakfast they two went alone to the grave and his heart went out to his new friend and his untaught eloquence poured the praises of his buried idol into her ears without let or hindrance together they planted roses by the headboard and strewed wild flowers upon the grave and then together they went away hand in hand and left the dead to the long sleep that heals all heart aches and ends all sorrows')]"
