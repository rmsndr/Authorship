Objective of the project is predicting delayed arrival of flights for Dallas Fort worth airport.
Arrival delays of flights are defined as the flights that arrive 15 or more minutes late.

As per the analysis done, attributes such as month, hour of the day, carrier and weather plays an important role in predicting delays. 
Months during summer and December; holiday season were more likely for a delayed flight. 
Unpredictable nature of thunderstorms during this period also accounts for the delay.
 
Also, Delays during the peak hours; 18:00-22:00 were common. 
Accumulated delays from morning flights augments to flights in the later hour of the day, this creates a chain of delays and can become unmanageable. 
So airline authorities should make required amendments such as better management during holiday season, hiring additional staff to reduce the effect of preceding flights on subsequent ones.
 
As per the analysis, low cost airlines account for much delay when compared to established carriers. 
The low cost airlines, apart from providing economical flights, should also try to provide better services to sustain in competitive aviation industry.
 
The best model is predicted by random forest after considering the weather data, so weather plays a significant role in predicting the delays. 
Comparatively, the delays due to light thunderstorms were more than heavy thunderstorms, this is due to the unpredictable nature of light thunderstorms which rise abruptly and mostly unnoticed prior hand. 
Better prediction of light thunder storms will help the aviation industry in decreasing the delay of flights.
